The image provides an overview of the **AirPort Time Capsule**, a product developed by Apple Inc. It is a wireless router that also serves as network-attached storage (NAS) and a residential gateway router. Key details include:

- **Type**: Backup drive and AirPort Extreme base station.
- **Release Date**: February 29, 2008.
- **Discontinued**: April 26, 2018.
- **Storage Capacity**: Ranges from 500 GB to 3 TB with server-grade HDD.
- **Website**: [Apple Time Capsule](https://www.apple.com/timecapsule)

The text mentions its compatibility with Time Machine backup software introduced in Mac OS X 10.5. The device has undergone several upgrades to enhance wireless performance.

Guest Networking, a feature which allows creation of a separate wireless network for guests. The guest network
uses different authentication credentials, ensuring the security of the primary network.[[4]] The hard disk storage
space of each model was doubled: capacities were 1 TB 2 TB, while the prices remained unchanged.[[5]]

In October 2009, several news sites reported that many first generation Time Capsules were failing after 18
months,[[6]] with some users alleging that this was due to a design failure in the power supplies.[[7]] Apple
confirmed that certain Time Capsules sold between February 2008 and June 2008 do not power on, or may
unexpectedly turn off. Apple offered free repair or replacement to affected units.[[8]]

The third generation Time Capsule was released in October 2009. The only change was a reconfiguration of the
internal wireless antenna, resulting in an Apple-reported 50% increase in wireless performance and 25%
increase in wireless range when compared to previous models.[[9]]

The fourth generation Time Capsule, released in June 2011, increased the range of WiFi signals. The internal
[Wi-Fi card was changed from a Marvell Wi-Fi chip to a better-performing Broadcom BCM4331 chip.[[10]] Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi)
again increased the storage space in each model as the hard drive sizes were increased to 2 and 3 TB. The 2 TB
and 3 TB models were kept at the $299 and $499 price points.

The fifth generation Time Capsule was released in June 2013 alongside the sixth generation AirPort Extreme.
This generation saw the name change to AirPort Time Capsule and to a taller form factor. 802.11ac support was
added with this generation. The 2 TB model was kept at $299, but the 3 TB model dropped to $399.

## Features

[The currently available fifth generation Time Capsule includes a fully featured, 802.11ac, Wi-Fi access point[[11]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11ac)

[including simultaneous dual-band operation. The Time Capsule supports the Sleep Proxy Service,[[12]] a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_Proxy_Service)
technology that allows clients to partially shut down to conserve energy, yet still be responsive to network
traffic.

[Hardware interfaces on the Time Capsule include four Gigabit Ethernet ports (3 LAN ports, and 1 WAN port),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabit_Ethernet)
[and a USB interface for external peripheral device sharing. Commonly connected peripherals include printers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB)
[and external hard drives.[[13]] A built-in fileserver that supports both AFP and SMB provides network access to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol)
files stored on the built-in hard drive. The 7.6.1 Time Capsule firmware enables remote access of the harddisk
[with an iCloud account. In the past, users needed a MobileMe account to remotely access data. Fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud)
generation models are available with 2 TB and 3 TB of built-in storage.

The software is specially built by Apple and is not user modifiable. While the firmware has been decrypted,[[14]] a
[suitable privilege escalation exploit to run custom firmware is not developed for the latest firmware. However,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation)
[the device runs a POSIX standard platform. The Time Capsule up to the fourth generation runs on the ARM port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)
[of operating system NetBSD 4.0, while the fifth generation model runs NetBSD 6.[[15][16]] It is possible to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBSD)
[securely connect to the device via SSH and run statically-linked binaries on it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)

[One of the key features of Time Capsule is the ability to back up a system and files wirelessly and automatically,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup)
eliminating the need to attach an external backup drive. This feature requires OS X 10.5.2 Leopard or greater on
[the client computers. The backup software is Apple's Time Machine, which, by default, makes hourly images of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(Apple_software))
the files that are being changed, and condenses backup images as they become older, to save space. Even when
using an 802.11n wireless or Gigabit Ethernet connection, the initial backup of any Mac to the drive requires

significant time; Apple suggests that the first backup will take "overnight or longer".[[17]] Subsequent backups are
[incremental, thus will typically be quicker, as they only include changed files. Clients using Mac OS X Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_backup)
[Leopard, can perform the initial backup twice as fast as Leopard clients. The backup disk can also be used by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard)
[Windows-based computers, and the files on it can be managed by another OS such as Windows.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows)

[The hard drive typically found in a Time Capsule is the Hitachi Deskstar, which is sold by Hitachi as a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_Deskstar)
consumer-grade product—the Hitachi Ultrastar is the enterprise version.[[18]] Apple labeled the drive as a server[grade drive in promotional material for Time Capsule, and also used this type of drive in its discontinued Xserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xserve)
[servers. Apple states that the Hitachi Deskstar meets or exceeds the 1 million hours mean time between failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_between_failures)
(MTBF) recommendation for server-grade hard drives.[[19]]

The 500 GB, first generation Time Capsule shipped with a Seagate Barracuda ES-series drive.[[20]] More recently,
other hard drives such as the Western Digital Caviar Green series,[[21]] and the Samsung EcoGreen series have
been reported.

The Time Capsules up to the 4th generation measure 7.7 inches (20 cm) square, and 1.4 inches (3.6 cm) high,[[11]]

[slightly larger than the AirPort Extreme Base Station and close to the first generation Apple TV in volume. Its](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV)
size is partly due to the inclusion of an internal power supply, which eliminates the requirement for a separate
[external power supply, enabling a direct connection between the household power outlet and the back of the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_AC_power_plugs_and_sockets)
Time Capsule.

The June 2013 release of the 5th generation models features a name change to AirPort Time Capsule, and a
redesign with measurements 3.85 inches (9.8 cm) square, and 6.6 inches (17 cm) high. The square dimensions
[echo the size of both the latest AirPort Express and Apple TVs (2nd generation onwards), just with the height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPort_Express)
being significantly higher. The 2013 models feature the same I/O ports on the back as previous generations, and
come in the same capacities as the 4th generation of 2 TB & 3 TB, but have introduced the newest Wi-Fi
standard 802.11ac. The AirPort Extreme released at the same time is exactly the same in dimensions and I/O
ports, just without the internal harddrive of the AirPort Time Capsule. 2013 models feature faster download
speed, beam-forming improvements and wireless or desktop network control with iCloud integration. Airport is
compatible with devices using the 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac specifications. Also
improved, Airport Utility has added one click Time Capsule format from the utility's Airport Time Capsule, Edit,
Disks menu, allowing easy and rapid Erase Disk and Archive Disk to start over or configure Network. Disk
Erase includes up to 35 passes and device includes encrypted storage plus optional WAN sharing, making
Airport extremely secure and flexible for home, class and office environments. Airport Utility is a free
download.[[22]]

## Product numbers

Apple Time Capsule product codes are constructed with the 5 first characters identifying the "product version"
and the remaining ones indicating the localization, such as country-specific power supply.

As of the fourth generation, all generations have had two models; one with a smaller capacity hard drive, and
one with a larger capacity hard drive, with those always being priced at US$299 and US$499 respectively.
