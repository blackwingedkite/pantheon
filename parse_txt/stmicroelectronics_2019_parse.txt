**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

In this annual report on Form 20-F (the “Form 20-F”), references to “we”, “us” and “Company” are to
STMicroelectronics N.V. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, references to “EU” are to the European
Union, references to “€” and the “Euro” are to the Euro currency of the EU, references to the “United States”
and the “U.S.” are to the United States of America and references to “$” and to “U.S. dollars” are to United
States dollars. References to “mm” are to millimeters and references to “nm” are to nanometers.

We have compiled market size and our market share data in this Form 20-F using statistics and other
information obtained from several third-party sources. Except as otherwise disclosed herein, all references to
trade association data are references to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”). Certain terms used in
this Form 20-F are defined in “Certain Terms”.

We report our financial statements in U.S. dollars and prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). We also report
certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures (free cash flow and net financial position), which are derived from
the amounts presented in the financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, we are required by
Dutch law to report our Statutory and Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”)
and adopted by the European Union. The IFRS financial statements are reported separately and can differ
materially from the statements reported in U.S. GAAP.

Various amounts and percentages used in this Form 20-F have been rounded and, accordingly, they may
not total 100%.

We and our affiliates own or otherwise have rights to the trademarks and trade names, including those
mentioned in this Form 20-F, used in conjunction with the marketing and sale of our products.

**CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

Some of the statements contained in this Form 20-F that are not historical facts, particularly in “Item 3.
Key Information — Risk Factors”, “Item 4. Information on the Company” and “Item 5. Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects” and “— Business Outlook” are statements of future expectations and other
forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended) that are based on management’s current views and
assumptions, and are conditioned upon and also involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated by such statements due to,
among other factors:

-  changes in global trade policies, including the adoption and expansion of tariffs and trade barriers,
that could affect the macro-economic environment and adversely impact the demand for our
products;

-  uncertain macro-economic and industry trends, which may impact end-market demand for our
products;

-  customer demand that differs from projections;

-  the ability to design, manufacture and sell innovative products in a rapidly changing technological
environment;

-  changes in economic, social, public health, labor, political, or infrastructure conditions in the
locations where we, our customers, or our suppliers operate, including as a result of macroeconomic or regional events, military conflicts, social unrest, labor actions, or terrorist activities;

-  unanticipated events or circumstances, which may impact our ability to execute our plans and/or
meet the objectives of our R&D and manufacturing programs, which benefit from public funding;

-  the Brexit vote and the impact of the withdrawal of the U.K. may adversely affect business activity,
political stability and economic conditions in the U.K., the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. The
U.K. withdrawal from the EU took place on January 31, 2020 and the UK majority government is
expected to complete Brexit even if no formal withdrawal agreement is in place with the EU by the
end of the transition period running until December 31, 2020. The specific terms of the U.K.
withdrawal from the EU are still uncertain and while we do not have material operations in the U.K.

Table of Contents

and have not experienced any material impact from Brexit on our underlying business to date, we
cannot predict its future implications;

-  financial difficulties with any of our major distributors or significant curtailment of purchases by
key customers;

-  the loading, product mix, and manufacturing performance of our production facilities and/or our
required volume to fulfill capacity reserved with suppliers or third party manufacturing providers;

-  availability and costs of equipment, raw materials, utilities, third-party manufacturing services and
technology, or other supplies required by our operations;

-  the functionalities and performance of our IT systems, which are subject to cybersecurity threats and
which support our critical operational activities including manufacturing, finance and sales, and any
breaches of our IT systems or those of our customers or suppliers;

-  theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third parties, and
breaches of global and local privacy legislation, including the EU’s General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”);

-  the impact of intellectual property (“IP”) claims by our competitors or other third parties, and our
ability to obtain required licenses on reasonable terms and conditions;

-  changes in our overall tax position as a result of changes in tax rules, new or revised legislation, the
outcome of tax audits or changes in international tax treaties which may impact our results of
operations as well as our ability to accurately estimate tax credits, benefits, deductions and
provisions and to realize deferred tax assets;

-  variations in the foreign exchange markets and, more particularly, the U.S. dollar exchange rate as
compared to the Euro and the other major currencies we use for our operations;

-  the outcome of ongoing litigation as well as the impact of any new litigation to which we may
become a defendant;

-  product liability or warranty claims, claims based on epidemic or delivery failure, or other claims
relating to our products, or recalls by our customers for products containing our parts;

-  natural events such as severe weather, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcano eruptions or other acts of
nature, the effects of climate change, health risks and epidemics such as the novel coronavirus
COVID-19 in locations where we, our customers or our suppliers operate;

-  industry changes resulting from vertical and horizontal consolidation among our suppliers,
competitors, and customers; and

-  the ability to successfully ramp up new programs that could be impacted by factors beyond our
control, including the availability of critical third party components and performance of
subcontractors in line with our expectations.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual
results and performance of our business to differ materially and adversely from the forward-looking statements.
Certain forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as
“believes”, “expects”, “may”, “are expected to”, “should”, “would be”, “seeks” or “anticipates” or similar
expressions or the negative thereof or other variations thereof or comparable terminology, or by discussions of
strategy, plans or intentions. Some of these risk factors are set forth and are discussed in more detail in “Item 3.
Key Information — Risk Factors”. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this Form
20-F as anticipated, believed or expected. We do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update any
industry information or forward-looking statements set forth in this Form 20-F to reflect subsequent events or
circumstances.

Unfavorable changes in the above or other factors listed under “Item 3. Key Information — Risk Factors”
from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings, could have a material adverse
effect on our business and/or financial condition.

**Risks Related to the Semiconductor Industry which Impact Us**

**_We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, may be impacted by changes in, or uncertainty about, global,_**
**_regional and local economic, political, legal, regulatory and social environments as well as climate change._**

Changes in, and uncertainty about, economic, political, legal, regulatory and social conditions pose a risk
as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to factors such as curtailment of trade and
other business restrictions, financial market volatility, interest rate fluctuations, shifts in inflationary and
deflationary expectations, lower capital and productivity growth, unemployment, negative news, declines in
income or asset values and/or other factors. Such global, regional and local conditions could have a material
adverse effect on customer and end-market demand for our products, thus materially adversely affecting our
business and financial condition.

The institution of trade tariffs globally could negatively impact economic conditions, which could have
negative repercussions for our business. In 2019, both the U.S. Administration as well as several foreign
governments have been undertaking significant trade policy changes, in some cases followed by legislative or
executive action. For instance, the more recent phase one deal signed by U.S. and China in January 2020 still
leaves in place a significant number of tariffs until the second phase of the deal is agreed and there is no
assurance that further tariffs would not be applied in the future. Trade policy changes could trigger retaliatory
actions by affected countries, which could have a negative impact on our ability to do business in affected
countries or lead to reduced purchases of our products by foreign customers, leading to increased costs of
components contained in our products, increased manufacturing costs of our products, and higher prices for our
products in foreign markets. Further, protectionist measures, laws or governmental policies may encourage our
customers to relocate their manufacturing capacity or supply chain to their own respective countries or require
their respective contractors, subcontractors and relevant agents to do so, which could impair our ability to
sustain our current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency.

We, and the semiconductor industry as a whole, face greater risks due to the international nature of the
semiconductor business, including in the countries where we, our customers or our suppliers operate, such as:

-  instability of foreign governments, including the threat of war, military conflict, civil unrest, regime
changes, mass migration and terrorist attacks;

-  natural events such as severe weather, earthquakes and tsunamis, or the effects of climate change;

-  epidemics such as disease outbreaks or more recently the novel coronavirus COVID-19, pandemics
and other health related issues;

-  changes in, or uncertainty about, laws, regulations (including executive orders) and policies
affecting trade and investment, including following Brexit and including through the imposition of
trade and travel restrictions, government sanctions, local practices which favor local companies and
constraints on investment;

-  complex and varying government regulations and legal standards, particularly with respect to export
control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, data privacy, intellectual
property and anti-corruption; and

-  differing practices of regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative bodies, including with regards to
the interpretation of laws, governmental approvals, permits and licenses.

**_The semiconductor industry is cyclical and downturns in the semiconductor industry can negatively affect_**
**_our results of operations and financial condition._**

The semiconductor industry is cyclical and has been subject to significant downturns from time to time, as
a result of global economic conditions as well as industry-specific factors, such as built-in excess capacity,
fluctuations in product supply, product obsolescence and changes in end-customer preferences. Downturns are
typically characterized by reduction in overall demand, accelerated erosion of selling prices, reduced revenues
and high inventory levels, any of which could result in a significant deterioration of our results of operations.
Such macroeconomic trends typically relate to the semiconductor industry as a whole rather than to the
individual semiconductor markets to which we sell our products. To the extent that industry downturns are
concurrent with the timing of new increases in production capacity or introduction of new advanced
technologies in our industry, the negative effects on our business from such industry downturns may also be
more severe. We have experienced revenue volatility and market downturns in the past and expect to
experience them in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and
financial condition.


-----

Table of Contents

**_We may not be able to match our production capacity to demand._**

As a result of the cyclicality and volatility of the semiconductor industry, it is difficult to predict future
developments in the markets we serve, and, in turn, to estimate requirements for production capacity. If our
markets, major customers or certain product designs or technologies do not perform as well as we have
anticipated, we risk unused capacity charges, write-offs of inventories and losses on products, and we could be
required to undertake restructuring and transformation measures that may involve significant charges to our
earnings. Furthermore, during certain periods, we have also experienced increased demand in certain market
segments and product technologies, which has led to a shortage of capacity, an increase in the lead times of our
delivery to customers and, in certain instances, being required to enter into agreements with our suppliers with
onerous terms, such as take-or-pay arrangements. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects
— Results of Operations — Impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs”.

**_Competition in the semiconductor industry is intense, and we may not be able to compete successfully if our_**
**_product design technologies, process technologies and products do not meet market requirements._**
**_Furthermore, the competitive environment of the industry has resulted, and is expected to continue to result,_**
**_in vertical and horizontal consolidation among our suppliers, competitors and customers, which may lead to_**
**_erosion of our market share, impact our ability to compete and require us to restructure our operations._**

We compete in different product lines to various degrees on certain characteristics, for example, price,
technical performance, product features, product design, product availability, process technology, manufacturing
capabilities and sales and technical support. Given the intense competition in the semiconductor industry, if our
products do not meet market requirements based on any of these characteristics, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our competitors may have a stronger
presence in key markets and geographic regions, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater
government support and greater financial, research and development, sales and marketing, manufacturing,
distribution, technical and other resources than we do. These competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to
changes in the business environment, to new or emerging technologies and to changes in customer requirements.

The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by the high costs associated with
developing marketable products and manufacturing technologies as well as high levels of investment in
production capabilities. As a result, the semiconductor industry has experienced, and is expected to continue to
experience, significant vertical and horizontal consolidation among our suppliers, competitors and customers.
Consolidation in the semiconductor industry could erode our market share, negatively impact our ability to
compete and require us to increase our R&D effort, engage in mergers and acquisitions and/or restructure our
operations.

**Risks Related to Our Operations**

**_Our high fixed costs could adversely impact our results._**

Our operations are characterized by high fixed or other costs which are difficult to reduce, including costs
related to manufacturing, particularly as we operate our own manufacturing facilities, and the employment of
our highly skilled workforce. When demand for our products decreases, competition increases or we fail to
forecast demand accurately, we are driven to reduce prices and we are not always able to decrease our total costs
in line with resulting revenue declines. As a result, the costs associated with our operations may not be fully
absorbed, leading to unused capacity charges, higher average unit costs and lower gross margins, adversely
impacting our results.

**_Our capital needs are high compared to those competitors who do not manufacture their own products and_**
**_we may need additional funding in the coming years to finance our investments, to purchase other companies_**
**_or technologies developed by third parties or to refinance our maturing indebtedness._**

As a result of our choice to maintain control of a large portion of our manufacturing technologies and
capabilities, we may require significant capital expenditure to maintain or upgrade our facilities in the event that
our facilities become inadequate in terms of capacity, flexibility and location. We monitor our capital
expenditures taking into consideration factors such as trends in the semiconductor market, customer
requirements and capacity utilization. These capital expenditures may increase in the future if we decide to
upgrade or expand the capacity of our manufacturing facilities, purchase or build new facilities or increase
investments supporting key strategic initiatives. For instance, we may be unable to successfully maintain and
operate large infrastructure projects. Such increased capital expenditures associated with large infrastructure


-----

Table of Contents

projects and strategic initiatives might not achieve profitability or we may be unable to utilize infrastructure
projects to full capacity. There can also be no assurance that future market demand and products required by
our customers will meet our expectations. We also may need to invest in other companies, in IP and/or in
technology developed either by us or by third parties to maintain or improve our position in the market or to
reinforce our existing business. Failure to invest appropriately and in a timely manner or to successfully
integrate any recent or future business acquisitions may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits and
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The foregoing may require us to secure additional financing, including through the issuance of debt,
equity or both. The timing and the size of any new share or bond offering would depend upon market
conditions as well as a variety of other factors. In addition, the capital markets may from time to time offer
terms of financing that are particularly favorable. We cannot exclude that we may access the capital markets
opportunistically to take advantage of market conditions. Any such transaction or any announcement
concerning such a transaction could materially impact the market price of our common shares. If we are unable
to access capital on acceptable terms, this may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

**_Our operating results depend on our ability to obtain quality supplies on commercially reasonable terms. As_**
**_we depend on a limited number of suppliers for materials, equipment and technology, we may experience_**
**_supply disruptions if suppliers interrupt supply, increase prices or experience material adverse changes in_**
**_their financial condition._**

Our ability to meet our customers’ demand to manufacture our products depends upon obtaining adequate
supplies of quality materials on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms. Certain materials are
available from a limited number of suppliers or only from a limited number of suppliers in a particular region.
We purchase certain materials whose prices on the world markets have fluctuated significantly in the past and
may fluctuate significantly in the future. Although supplies for most of the materials we currently use are
adequate, shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand
in the industry. For instance, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak could cause disruptions from the
temporary closure of suppliers’ facilities in China or delays and reduced export or shipment of various materials.
In addition, the costs of certain materials may increase due to market pressures and we may not be able to pass
on such cost increases to our customers.

We also purchase semiconductor manufacturing equipment and third party licensed technology from a
limited number of suppliers and providers and, because such equipment and technology are complex, it is
difficult to replace one supplier or provider with another or to substitute one piece of equipment or type of
technology for another. In addition, suppliers and providers may extend lead times, limit our supply, increase
prices or change contractual terms related to certain manufacturing equipment and third party licensed
technology, any of which could adversely affect our results. Furthermore, suppliers and technology providers
tend to focus their investments on providing the most technologically advanced equipment, materials and
technology and may not be in a position to address our requirements for equipment, materials or technology of
older generations. Although we work closely with our suppliers and providers to avoid such shortages, there
can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future.

Consolidation among our suppliers or vertical integration among our competitors may limit our ability to
obtain sufficient quantities of materials, equipment and/or technology on commercially reasonable terms and
engage in mergers and acquisitions. In certain instances, we may be required to enter into agreements with our
suppliers with onerous terms, such as take-or-pay arrangements. If we are unable to obtain supplies of
materials, equipment or technology in a timely manner or at all, or if such materials, equipment or technology
prove inadequate or too costly, our results of operations could be adversely affected.


-----

Table of Contents

**_Our financial results can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates, principally in the value of the U.S._**
**_dollar._**

Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations because our reporting currency is the
U.S. dollar, in which we receive the major portion of our revenues, while, more importantly, we incur a limited
portion of our revenue and a significantly higher portion of our costs in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. A
significant variation of the value of the U.S. dollar against the principal currencies that have a material impact
on us (primarily the Euro, but also certain other currencies of countries where we have operations, such as the
Singapore dollar) could result in a favorable impact, net of hedging, on our net income in the case of an
appreciation of the U.S. dollar, or a negative impact, net of hedging, on our net income if the U.S. dollar
depreciates relative to these currencies, in particular with respect to the Euro.

In order to reduce the exposure of our financial results to the fluctuations in exchange rates, our principal
strategy has been to balance as much as possible the proportion of sales to our customers denominated in U.S.
dollars with the amount of purchases from our suppliers denominated in U.S. dollars and to reduce the weight of
the other costs, including depreciation, denominated in Euros and in other currencies. In order to further reduce
our exposure to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations, we have hedged certain line items on our Consolidated
Statements of Income, in particular with respect to a portion of the cost of sales, the majority of the R&D
expenses and certain SG&A expenses located in the Euro zone. We also hedge certain manufacturing costs,
included within the cost of sales, denominated in Singapore dollars. There can be no assurance that our hedging
transactions will prevent us from incurring higher Euro-denominated manufacturing costs and/or operating
expenses when translated into our U.S. dollar-based accounts. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review
and Prospects — Impact of Changes in Exchange Rates” and “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk”.

**_Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and annually and may also differ_**
**_significantly from our expectations or guidance._**

Our operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect
revenues and profitability or lead to significant variability of our operating results from one period to the next.
These factors include changes in demand from our key customers, capital requirements, inventory management,
availability of funding, competition, new product developments, start of adoption of our new products by
customers, technological changes, manufacturing or supplier issues and effective tax rates. In addition, in
periods of industry overcapacity or when our key customers encounter difficulties in their end-markets or
product ramps, orders are more exposed to cancellations, reductions, price renegotiation or postponements,
which in turn reduce our ability to forecast the next quarter or full year production levels, revenues and margins.
For these reasons and others that we may not yet have identified, our revenues and operating results may differ
materially from our expectations or guidance as visibility is reduced. See “Item 4. Information on the Company
— Backlog”.

**_If our external silicon foundries or back-end subcontractors fail to perform, this could adversely affect our_**
**_business prospects._**

We currently use external silicon foundries and back-end subcontractors for a portion of our
manufacturing activities. If our external silicon foundries or back-end subcontractors are unable to satisfy our
demand, or experience manufacturing difficulties, delays or reduced yields, our results of operations and ability
to satisfy customer demand could suffer. Likewise, if we are unable to meet our commitments to silicon
foundries and back-end subcontractors, our results of operations could suffer. Prices for these services also vary
depending on capacity utilization rates at our external silicon foundries and back-end subcontractors, quantities
demanded and product and process technology. Such outsourcing costs can vary materially and, in cases of
industry shortages, they can increase significantly, negatively impacting our business prospects.

**_Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, costly and potentially vulnerable to impurities, disruptions_**
**_or inefficient implementation of production changes or interruptions that can significantly increase our costs_**
**_and delay product shipments to our customers._**

Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and increasingly costly equipment and
are continuously modified or maintained in an effort to improve yields and product performance and lower the
cost of production.


-----

Table of Contents

Furthermore, impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields, interrupt
production or result in scrap. As system complexity and production changes have increased and sub-micron
technology has become more advanced, manufacturing tolerances have been reduced and requirements for
precision have become even more demanding. We have from time to time experienced bottlenecks and
production difficulties that have caused delivery delays and quality control problems. There can be no
assurance that we will not experience bottlenecks or production, transition or other difficulties in the future.

In addition, we are exposed to risks related to interruptions of our manufacturing processes. If any of our
property or equipment is damaged or otherwise rendered unusable or inoperable due to accident, cyberattack or
otherwise this could result in interruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating_**
**_margin and product liability or warranty claims._**

We sell complex products that may not in each case comply with specifications or customer requirements,
or may contain design or manufacturing defects, that could cause personal injury, property damage or security
risks that could be exploited by unauthorized third parties hacking, corrupting or otherwise obtaining access to
our products, including the software loaded thereon by us, our suppliers or our customers. Although our general
practice is to contractually limit our liability to the repair, replacement or refund of defective products, we
occasionally agree to contractual terms with key customers in which we provide extended warranties and
accordingly we may face product liability, warranty, delivery failure, and/or other claims relating to our
products that could result in significant expenses relating to compensation payments, product recalls or other
actions related to such extended warranties and/or to maintain good customer relationships, which could result
in decreased sales and operating margin and other material adverse effects on our business. Costs or payments
we may make in connection with warranty and other claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results
of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining our relationships with
customers with whom we incur quality problems. Furthermore, if litigation occurs we could incur significant
costs and liabilities to defend ourselves against such claims and, if damages are awarded against us, there can be
no assurance that our insurance policies will be available or adequate to protect us against such claims.

**_Disruptions in our relationships with any one of our key customers or distributors, and/or material changes_**
**_in their strategy or financial condition or business prospects, could adversely affect our results of operations._**

A substantial portion of our sales is derived from a limited number of customers and distributors. There
can be no assurance that our customers or distributors will continue to book the same level of sales with us that
they have in the past, will continue to succeed in the markets they serve and will not purchase competing
products over our products. Many of our key customers and distributors operate in cyclical businesses that are
also highly competitive, and their own market positions may vary considerably. In recent years, some of our
customers have vertically integrated their businesses. Such vertical integrations may impact our business. Our
relationships with the newly formed entities could be either reinforced or jeopardized by the integration. If we
are unable to maintain or increase our market share with our key customers or distributors, or if they were to
increase product returns or fail to meet payment obligations, our results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. Certain of our products are customized to our customers’ specifications. If customers do not
purchase products made specifically for them, we may not be able to recover a cancellation fee from our
customers or resell such products to other customers. In addition, the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks such as
the novel coronavirus COVID-19 could affect our customers. While the geographic spread of the novel
coronavirus cannot COVID-19 be predicted and its future developments are uncertain, if its severity increases,
the adverse public health impact on our customers could negatively affect our results.

**_We may experience delays in delivering our product and technology roadmaps as well as transformation_**
**_initiatives._**

Our industry adapts to technological advancements and it is likely that new products, equipment,
processes and service methods, including transformation initiatives related to digitalization, are in the process of
being implemented. Any failure by us to react to changes or advances in existing technologies and processes as
we develop and invest in our product, technology and transformation roadmaps could materially delay the
introduction of new solutions. If we are not able to execute on these roadmaps on a timely basis or at an
acceptable cost this could result in loss of competitiveness of our solutions, decreased revenue and a loss of
market share.

**_Our computer systems, including hardware, software, information and cloud-based initiatives, are subject to_**
**_attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity threats, which, if successful, could adversely impact our_**
**_business._**

We have, from time to time, experienced attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our computer
systems and networks. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and software,
and our ability to expand and continually update technologies, including to transition to cloud-based
technologies, in response to our changing needs is critical to our business. In the current environment, there are
numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, terrorism,
industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, vandalism and human or technological error. Computer hackers
and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems, and those of
our customers, suppliers and providers of third party licensed technology, and some of those attempts may be
successful. Such breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse,
loss, or destruction of our, our customer, or other third party data or systems, theft of our trade secrets and other
sensitive or confidential data, including personal information and intellectual property, system disruptions, and
denial of service. The attempts to breach our systems, including cloud-based systems, and gain unauthorized
access to our information technology systems are becoming increasingly more sophisticated. These attempts
may include covertly introducing malware to our computers, including those in our manufacturing operations,
and impersonating unauthorized users, among others. For instance, employees and former employees, in
particular former employees who become employees of our competitors or customers, may misappropriate, use,
publish or provide to our competitors or customers our intellectual property and/or proprietary or confidential
business information. Also, third parties may attempt to register domain names similar to our brands or website,
which could cause confusion and divert online customers away from our products. In the event of such
breaches, we, our customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and
regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our reputation, and other
financial loss and such breaches could also result in losing existing or potential customers in connection with
any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems. In addition, the cost and operational
consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. As these
threats continue to develop and grow, we have been adapting and strengthening our security measures. We
continue to increase the resources we allocate to implementing, maintaining and/or updating security systems to
protect data and infrastructure and to raising security awareness among those having access to our systems.
However, these security measures cannot provide absolute security and there can be no assurance that our
employee training, operational, and other technical security measures or other controls will detect, prevent or
remediate security or data breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to,
or interruption of our systems and operations. We regularly evaluate our IT systems to make enhancements and
periodically implement new or upgraded systems, as for instance the transition and migration of our data
systems to cloud-based platforms. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to
different systems could adversely affect our ability to record and report financial and management information
on a timely and accurate basis. In addition, a miscalculation of the level of investment needed to ensure our
technology solutions are current and up-to-date as technology advances and evolves could result in disruptions
in our business should the software, hardware or maintenance of such items become out-of-date or obsolete and
the costs of upgrading our cybersecurity systems and remediating damages could be substantial. We may also
be adversely affected by security breaches related to our equipment providers and providers of third party
licensed technology. As a global enterprise, we could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and
regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection.
Additionally, cyberattacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power,
information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or
delays to us, our customers, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, potential liability, and
damage our reputation and affect our relationships with our customers and suppliers.

**_We may be subject to theft, loss, or misuse of personal data about our employees, customers, or other third_**
**_parties, which could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory_**
**_proceedings._**

The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business
could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Global privacy
legislation, including various EU regulations and directives regulating data privacy and security, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the transmission of content using the Internet involving
residents of the EU, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex
compliance regulatory environment.

In particular, the requirements of the GDPR impose a higher compliance burden on us and materially
increase the maximum level of fines for compliance failures from their current levels relating to, among other
things, consent to process personal data of individuals, the information provided to individuals regarding the
processing of their personal data, the security and confidentiality of personal data, and notifications in the event
of data breaches and use of third party processors. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related
and data protection measures may increase and may necessitate changes to our business. In addition, our failure
to comply with local and international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in
proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Failure to comply with the GDPR or other data
privacy regimes could subject us to significant fines and reputational harm.

Further, privacy-related legislation is rapidly evolving which may have a negative impact on our business
if interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent from country to country and inconsistent with the
current policies and practices of our customers or business partners. We may also have to change the manner in
which we contract with our business partners, store and transfer information and otherwise conduct our
business, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues. In particular, the requirements of the GDPR
will impose a higher compliance burden on us and materially increase the maximum level of fines for
compliance failures from their current levels. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and
data protection measures could be significant. In addition, our failure to comply with local and international
privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities
or others.

**_Our business is dependent in large part on continued growth in the industries and segments into which our_**
**_products are sold and on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones. A market decline in_**
**_any of these industries, our inability to retain and attract customers, or customer demand for our products_**
**_which differs from our projections, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

The demand for our products depends significantly on the demand for our customers’ end products.
Growth of demand in the industries and segments into which our products are sold fluctuates significantly and is
driven by a variety of factors, including consumer spending, consumer preferences, the development and
acceptance of new technologies and prevailing economic conditions. Changes in our customers’ markets and in
our customers’ respective shares in such markets could result in slower growth and a decline in demand for our
products. In addition, if projected industry growth rates do not materialize as forecasted, our spending on
process and product development ahead of market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers. In 2019 our largest customer,
Apple, accounted for 17.6% of our revenues. While we do not believe to be dependent on any one customer or
group of customers, the loss of key customers or important sockets at key customers could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations. Our existing customers’ product strategy may change from time to time
and/or product specifications may change on short-time product life cycles and we have no certainty that our
business, financial position and results of operations will not be affected. Our business is also dependent upon
our ability to attract new customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and
retaining new customers, or in adequately projecting customer demand for our products. Our failure to do so
could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Market dynamics have driven, and continue to drive us, to a strategic repositioning._**

In recent years, we have undertaken several initiatives to reposition our business. Our strategies to
improve our results of operations and financial condition have led us, and may in the future lead us, to acquire
businesses that we believe to be complementary to our own, or to divest ourselves of or wind down activities
that we believe do not serve our longer term business plans. Our potential acquisition strategies depend in part
on our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, finance their acquisition, obtain approval by our
shareholders and obtain required regulatory and other approvals. Our potential divestiture strategies depend in
part on our ability to compete and to identify the activities in which we should no longer engage, obtain the
relevant approvals pursuant to our governance process and then determine and execute appropriate methods to
divest of them.

We are constantly monitoring our product portfolio and cannot exclude that additional steps in this
repositioning process may be required. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any strategic repositioning of our
business, including executed and possible future acquisitions or dispositions, will be successful and will not
result in impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs.

Acquisitions and divestitures involve a number of risks that could adversely affect our operating results
and financial condition, including: we may be unable to successfully integrate businesses or teams we acquire
with our culture and strategies on a timely basis or at all; and we may be required to record charges related to
the goodwill or other long-term assets associated with the acquired businesses. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to achieve the full scope of the benefits we expect from a particular acquisition, divestiture or
investment. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer if we fail to coordinate our
resources effectively to manage both our existing businesses and any acquired businesses. In addition, the
financing of future acquisitions or divestitures may negatively impact our financial position, including our
ability to pay a dividend and/or repurchase our shares, and credit rating and we could be required to raise
additional funding.

Other risks associated with acquisitions include: assumption of potential liabilities, disclosed or
undisclosed, associated with the business acquired, which liabilities may exceed the amount of indemnification
available from the seller; potential inaccuracies in the financials of the business acquired; and our ability to
retain customers of an acquired entity, its business or industrialize an acquired process or technology. Identified
risks associated with divestitures include: loss of activities and technologies that may have complemented our
remaining businesses or operations; and loss of important services provided by key employees that are assigned
to divested activities.

**_We depend on collaboration with other semiconductor industry companies, research organizations,_**
**_universities, customers and suppliers to further our R&D efforts, and our business and prospects could be_**
**_materially adversely affected by the failure or termination of such alliances._**

Our success depends on our ability to introduce innovative new products and technologies to the
marketplace on a timely basis. In light of the high levels of investment required for R&D activities, we depend
in certain instances on collaborations with other semiconductor industry companies, research organizations,
universities, customers and suppliers to develop or access new technologies.

Such collaboration provides us with a number of important benefits, including the sharing of costs,
reductions in our own capital requirements, acquisitions of technical know-how and access to additional
production capacities. However, there can be no assurance that our collaboration efforts will be successful and
allow us to develop and access new technologies in due time, in a cost-effective manner and/or to meet customer
demands. If a particular collaboration terminates before our intended goals are accomplished we may incur
additional unforeseen costs, and our business and prospects could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we are
unable to develop or otherwise access new technologies, whether independently or in collaboration with another
industry participant, we may fail to keep pace with the rapid technology advances in the semiconductor industry,
our participation in the overall semiconductor industry may decrease and we may also lose market share.

**_We depend on patents to protect our rights to our technology and may face claims of infringing the IP rights_**
**_of others._**

We depend on patents and other IP rights to protect our products and our manufacturing processes against
misappropriation by others. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive, and there can
be no assurance that that we will receive patents from currently pending or future applications. Even if patents
are issued, they may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial
advantage. In addition, effective IP protection may be unavailable or limited in some countries. Our ability to
enforce one or more of our patents could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, laws in certain foreign
jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property rights or by ineffective enforcement of
laws in such jurisdictions. Competitors may also develop technologies that are protected by patents and other IP
and therefore either be unavailable to us or be made available to us subject to adverse terms and conditions. We
have in the past used our patent portfolio to negotiate broad patent cross-licenses with many of our competitors
enabling us to design, manufacture and sell semiconductor products, without concern of infringing patents held
by such competitors. We may not in the future be able to obtain such licenses or other rights to protect
necessary IP on favorable terms for the conduct of our business, and such failure may adversely impact our
results of operations. Such cross-license agreements expire from time to time and there is no assurance that we
can or we will extend them.

We have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, communications alleging possible
infringement of third party patents and other IP rights. Some of those claims are made by so-called nonpracticing entities against which we are unable to assert our own patent portfolio to lever licensing terms and
conditions. Competitors with whom we do not have patent cross-license agreements may also develop
technologies that are protected by patents and other IP rights and which may be unavailable to us or only made
available on unfavorable terms and conditions. We may therefore become involved in costly litigation brought
against us regarding patents and other IP rights. See Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. IP
litigation may also involve our customers who in turn may seek indemnification from us should we not prevail
and/or who may decide to curtail their orders for those of our products over which claims have been asserted.
Such lawsuits may therefore have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be forced to stop
producing substantially all or some of our products or to license the underlying technology upon economically
unfavorable terms and conditions or we may be required to pay damages for the prior use of third party IP
and/or face an injunction.

The outcome of IP litigation is inherently uncertain and may divert the efforts and attention of our
management and other specialized technical personnel. Such litigation can result in significant costs and, if not
resolved in our favor, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We operate in many jurisdictions with highly complex and varied tax regimes. Changes in tax rules, new or_**
**_revised legislation or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could cause a material adverse effect on our_**
**_results._**

We operate in many jurisdictions with highly complex and varied tax regimes. Changes in tax rules, new
or revised legislation or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have a material adverse effect on our
results. Our tax rate is variable and depends on changes in the level of operating results within various local
jurisdictions and on changes in the applicable taxation rates of these jurisdictions, as well as changes in
estimated tax provisions due to new events. We currently receive certain tax benefits or benefit from net
operating losses cumulated in prior years in some countries, and these benefits may not be available in the future
due to changes in the local jurisdictions or credits on net operating losses being no longer available due to either
full utilization or expiration of the statute of limitations in such jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate
could increase and/or our benefits from carrying forward net operating losses could affect our deferred tax assets
in certain countries in the coming years. In addition, the acquisition or divestiture of businesses in certain
jurisdictions could materially affect our effective tax rate.

Table of Contents

We evaluate our deferred tax asset position and the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to generate future
taxable income that is sufficient to utilize in certain jurisdictions loss carry-forwards or tax credits before their
expiration or our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax optimization strategies. The recorded amount of
total deferred tax assets could be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial position, if our estimates of projected future taxable income and benefits from available
tax strategies are reduced as a result of a change in business condition or in management’s plans or due to other
factors, such as changes in tax laws and regulations.

We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims, assessment of uncertain
tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures. We are also subject to tax audits
in certain jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims
that result from these audits, which could result in material adjustments in our tax positions. We record
provisions on the basis of the best current understanding; however, we could be required to record additional
provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot currently be assessed. Our failure to do so and/or the need
to increase our provisions for such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
our financial position.

**_Our operating results can also vary significantly due to impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets_**
**_incurred in the course of acquisitions and equity investments, as well as to impairment of tangible assets due_**
**_to changes in the business environment._**

Our operating results can vary significantly due to impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and
equity investments booked pursuant to acquisitions, joint venture agreements and the purchase of technologies
and licenses from third parties, as well as to impairment of tangible assets due to changes in the business
environment. Because the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant
changes in the semiconductor industry, and the potential failure of our business initiatives, our future cash flows
may not support the value of goodwill, tangible assets and other intangibles registered in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — Overview — Critical
Accounting Policies Using Significant Estimates — Impairment of goodwill”, “— Intangible assets subject to
amortization”, “— Tangible assets” and “— Income (loss) on Equity-method Investments”.

**_We receive public funding, and a reduction in the amount available to us or demands for repayment could_**
**_increase our costs and impact our results of operations._**

To support our proprietary R&D for technology investments and investments in cooperative R&D
ventures, we have in the past obtained public funding and expect to obtain public funding in the future, mainly
from French, Italian and EU governmental entities. The public funding we receive is subject to periodic review
by the relevant authorities and there can be no assurance that we will continue to benefit from such programs at
current levels or that sufficient alternative funding will be available if we lose such support. If any of the public
funding programs we participate in are curtailed or discontinued and we do not reduce the relevant R&D costs,
this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, to receive public funding, we enter into
agreements which require compliance with extensive regulatory requirements and set forth certain conditions
relating to the funded programs. If we fail to meet the regulatory requirements or applicable conditions, we
may, under certain circumstances, be required to refund previously received amounts, which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. If there are changes in the public funding we receive this
could increase the net costs for us to continue investing in R&D at current levels and could result in a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

**_Some of our production processes and materials are environmentally sensitive, which could expose us to_**
**_liability and increase our costs due to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or because of_**
**_damage to the environment._**

We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern various aspects,
including the use, storage, discharge and disposal of chemicals, gases and other hazardous substances used in
our operations. Compliance with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our manufacturing costs or
product sales by requiring us to acquire costly equipment, materials or greenhouse gas allowances, or to incur
other significant expenses in adapting our manufacturing processes or waste and emission disposal processes.
Furthermore, environmental claims or our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the
assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension of production or a cessation of operations.
Failure by us to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, chemicals or hazardous substances
could subject us to future liabilities.

**_Climate change and related sustainability initiatives could place additional burden on us and our operations._**

As climate change issues become more pronounced, we may correspondingly face increased expectations
from our stakeholders to take actions beyond existing regulatory requirements to minimize our impact on the
environment and mitigate climate change related effects. To meet these additional requirements, we may need
to deploy additional equipment, introduce process changes, utilize alternative suppliers and materials, and take
other similar actions, some or all of which may require us to incur additional costs which could result in a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position. In addition, if we fail to meet
these expectations, or foster additional sustainability initiatives, we may experience reputational risk which
could impact our ability to attract and retain customers, employees, and investors.

**_Loss of key employees and the inability to continuously recruit and retain qualified employees could hurt our_**
**_competitive position._**

Our success depends to a significant extent upon our key executives and R&D, engineering, marketing,
sales, manufacturing, support and other personnel. Our success also depends upon our ability to continue to
identify, attract, retain and motivate highly trained and skilled engineering, technical and professional personnel
in a competitive recruitment environment. For instance, in highly specialized areas, it may become more
difficult to retain employees. We intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain
qualified employees, however, we may not be able to attract, obtain and retain these employees, which may
affect our growth in future years and the loss of the services of any of these key personnel without adequate
replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder, which is in turn indirectly controlled by the French and Italian_**
**_governments, may conflict with other investors’ interests. In addition, our controlling shareholder may sell_**
**_our existing common shares or issue financial instruments exchangeable into our common shares at any_**
**_time._**

We have been informed that as of December 31, 2019, STMicroelectronics Holding N.V. (“ST Holding”),
owned 250,704,754 shares, or approximately 27.5%, of our issued common shares. ST Holding may therefore
be in a position to effectively control the outcome of decisions submitted to the vote at our shareholders’
meetings, including but not limited to the appointment of the members of our Managing and Supervisory
Boards.

We have been informed that ST Holding’s shareholders, each of which is ultimately controlled by the
French or Italian government, are party to a shareholders agreement (the “STH Shareholders Agreement”),
which governs relations between them. We are not a party to the STH Shareholders Agreement. See “Item 7.
Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions — Major Shareholders”. The STH Shareholders Agreement
includes provisions requiring the unanimous approval by the shareholders of ST Holding before ST Holding can
vote its shares in our share capital, which may give rise to a conflict of interest between our interests and
investors’ interests, on the one hand, and the (political) interests of ST Holding’s shareholders, on the other
hand. Our ability to issue new shares or other securities giving access to our shares may be limited by ST
Holding’s desire to maintain its shareholding at a certain level and our ability to buy back shares may be limited
by ST Holding due to a Dutch law requiring one or more shareholders acquiring 30% or more of our voting
rights to launch a tender offer for our outstanding shares.

The STH Shareholders Agreement also permits our respective French and Italian indirect shareholders to
cause ST Holding to dispose of its stake in us at any time, thereby reducing the current level of their respective
indirect interests in our common shares. Sales of our common shares or the issuance of financial instruments
exchangeable into our common shares or any announcements concerning a potential sale by ST Holding could
materially impact the market price of our common shares depending on the timing and size of such sale, market
conditions as well as a variety of other factors.

**_Our shareholder structure and our preference shares may deter a change of control._**

We have an option agreement in place with an independent foundation, whereby the foundation can
acquire preference shares in the event of actions which the board of the independent foundation determines
would be contrary to our interests, our shareholders and our other stakeholders and which in the event of a
creeping acquisition or offer for our common shares are not supported by our Managing Board and Supervisory
Board. In addition, our shareholders have authorized us to issue additional capital within the limits of the
authorization by our General Meeting of Shareholders, subject to the requirements of our Articles of

16

Table of Contents

Association, without the need to seek a specific shareholder resolution for each capital increase. Accordingly,
an issue of preference shares or new shares may make it more difficult for a shareholder to obtain control over
our General Meeting of Shareholders. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of
our shareholders to benefit from a change in control and, as a result, may materially adversely affect the market
price of our ordinary shares and our investors’ ability to realize any potential change of control premium. See
“Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions — Major Shareholders — Preference Shares”.

**_Any decision to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could adversely impact the_**
**_market price of our common shares._**

On an annual basis, our Supervisory Board, upon the proposal of the Managing Board, may propose the
distribution of a cash dividend to the general meeting of our shareholders. See “Item 8. Dividend Policy”. Any
reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market
price of our common shares to decline.

**_We are required to prepare financial statements under IFRS and we also prepare Consolidated Financial_**
**_Statements under U.S. GAAP, and such dual reporting may impair the clarity of our financial reporting._**

We use U.S. GAAP as our primary set of reporting standards. Applying U.S. GAAP in our financial
reporting is designed to ensure the comparability of our results to those of our competitors, as well as the
continuity of our reporting, thereby providing our stakeholders and potential investors with a clear
understanding of our financial performance. As we are incorporated in The Netherlands and our shares are
listed on Euronext Paris and on the Borsa Italiana, we are subject to EU regulations requiring us to also report
our results of operations and financial statements using IFRS.

As a result of the obligation to report our financial statements under IFRS, we prepare our results of
operations using both U.S. GAAP and IFRS, which are currently not consistent. Such dual reporting can
materially increase the complexity of our financial communications. Our financial condition and results of
operations reported in accordance with IFRS will differ from our financial condition and results of operations
reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which could give rise to confusion in the marketplace.

**_There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls._**

There can be no assurance that a system of internal control over financial reporting, including one
determined to be effective, will prevent or detect all misstatements. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance regarding financial statement
preparation and presentation. Projections of the results of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting into future periods are subject to inherent risk. The relevant controls may become
inadequate due to changes in circumstances or the degree of compliance with the underlying policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

**_Because we are subject to the corporate law of The Netherlands, U.S. investors might have more difficulty_**
**_protecting their interests in a court of law or otherwise than if we were a U.S. company._**

Our corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Association and by the laws governing corporations
incorporated in The Netherlands. The rights of our investors and the responsibilities of members of our
Managing and Supervisory Boards under Dutch law are not as clearly established as under the rules of some
U.S. jurisdictions. Therefore, U.S. investors may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of
actions by our management, members of our Managing and Supervisory Boards or our controlling shareholders
than U.S. investors would have if we were incorporated in the United States.

Our executive offices and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States. In
addition, ST Holding and most members of our Managing and Supervisory Boards are residents of jurisdictions
other than the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for shareholders to effect service
within the United States upon us, ST Holding, or members of our Managing or Supervisory Boards. It may also
be difficult or impossible for shareholders to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such
persons in U.S. courts, or to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against such persons in courts in
jurisdictions outside the United States. This could be true in any legal action, including actions predicated upon
the civil liability provisions of U.S. securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult or impossible for
shareholders to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States,
rights predicated upon U.S. securities laws.

Table of Contents

We have been advised by Dutch counsel that the United States and The Netherlands do not currently have
a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in
civil and commercial matters. With respect to choice of court agreements in civil or commercial matters, it is
noted that the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements entered into force in the Netherlands, but has
not entered into force in the United States. As a consequence, a final judgment for the payment of money
rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated
solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States, will not be enforceable in The Netherlands.
However, if the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in
The Netherlands, such party may submit to The Netherlands court the final judgment that has been rendered in
the United States. If The Netherlands court finds that the jurisdiction of the federal or state court in the United
States has been based on grounds that are internationally acceptable and that proper legal procedures that are in
accordance with the Dutch standards of proper administration of justice including sufficient safeguards
(behoorlijke rechtspleging) have been observed, the court in The Netherlands would, under current practice, in
principle give binding effect to the final judgment that has been rendered in the United States unless such
judgment contradicts The Netherlands’ public policy and provided that the judgment by the foreign court is not
incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with a previous decision
rendered between the same parties by a foreign court in a dispute that concerns the same subject and is based on
the same cause, provided that the previous decision qualifies for acknowledgment in the Netherlands. Even if
such a foreign judgment is given binding effect, a claim based thereon may, however, still be rejected if the
foreign judgment is not or no longer formally enforceable.

**Item 4.** **Information on the Company**

**_History and Development of the Company_**

STMicroelectronics N.V. was formed and incorporated in 1987 as a result of the combination of the
semiconductor business of SGS Microelettronica (then owned by Società Finanziaria Telefonica (S.T.E.T.), an
Italian corporation) and the non-military business of Thomson Semiconducteurs (then owned by the former
Thomson-CSF, now Thales, a French corporation). We completed our initial public offering in December 1994
with simultaneous listings on the Bourse de Paris (now known as “Euronext Paris”) and the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”). In 1998, we also listed our shares on the Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (“Borsa Italiana”).

We operated as SGS-Thomson Microelectronics N.V. until May 1998, when we changed our name to
STMicroelectronics N.V. We are organized under the laws of The Netherlands, with our corporate legal seat in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and our head offices at WTC Schiphol Airport, Schiphol Boulevard 265, 1118

Below is a description of our main categories of products.

Automotive and Discrete Group (ADG)

_Dedicated Automotive ICs_

We are a top automotive semiconductor vendor supplying solutions to leading suppliers of carmakers
worldwide. We combine an unparalleled platform of advanced technologies with an unswerving commitment to
quality, and a thorough understanding of the automotive market gained through close collaboration with leading
customers. Our automotive-solutions portfolio covers all key application areas in the car: Powertrain, Chassis,
Safety and Security, including ADAS, Body Electronics, Infotainment and Connectivity.

For Powertrain, we provide silicon solutions for the full range of engine-management systems: from
motorbikes and scooters to the most advanced drive-by-wire solutions. Developments in engine management
are driven by both government emission regulations and energy concerns. We continue to work closely with
major automotive OEMs, as we have for decades, to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emission via advanced
technologies such as Variable Valve Timing and Gasoline Direct Injection and Battery Management for hybrid
and full electric cars. Due to the cooperation with certain leading car makers, our microcontrollers are currently
in the electrical engines of leading hybrid and electric cars.

With regards to Chassis, we provide a broad range of solutions to increase vehicle-occupant safety,
including devices for airbags, anti-lock brakes, traction control, electric power steering and active suspension
systems. We are a leading supplier of chips for automotive airbags and anti-lock braking systems, which
currently represent the largest portion of automotive safety electronics.

We are a leading player in ADAS that help avoid or minimize the severity of traffic accidents. We
manufacture leading-edge products for vision and radar (both short range 24GHz and long range 77GHz) based
systems that assist the driver with capabilities such as lane-departure warning, forward-collision warning,
vision/radar fusion and pedestrian detection including specific modular solutions for the mass market. We are
also working on our first-generation modular offering for V2X (vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure)
as society progresses toward semi- and fully-autonomous vehicles and Imaging Technologies for vehicles.

Today’s car body electronics involve a myriad of inter-networked electronic systems, from dome and
door-zone controls, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) systems, and seat controls to wiper and
lighting controls. The penetration of electronics in the car is increasing all the time, as are the requirements for
improved reliability and diagnostic capabilities. We address the concept of the “smart” junction box, which is
an intelligent power and switching center for the vehicle that integrates functions and features from exterior and
cabin lighting to wipers, with a comprehensive architecture that consists of upgradable hardware and software
modules. With our proprietary VIPower silicon technology and thorough application knowledge, we have
become a market leader in automotive lighting electronics, offering solutions for both exterior and interior
lighting, from incandescent bulbs to LED- or HID -based systems.

**Sales, Marketing and Distribution**

Our sales and marketing is organized by a combination of country/area coverage and key accounts
coverage with the primary objective of accelerating sales growth and gaining market share, particularly with
regards to: strengthening the effectiveness of the development of our global and major local accounts; boosting
demand creation through an enhanced focus on geographical coverage with strong technical expertise, supported
in the mass market by our distribution channel and local initiatives; and establishing regional sales and
marketing teams that are fully aligned with our strategic end-markets: automotive, industrial, personal
electronics and communications equipment, computers and peripherals.

We have three regional sales organizations reporting to a global head of Sales & Marketing: Americas;
Asia Pacific; and EMEA. Our regional sales organizations have a similar structure to enhance coordination in
global strategy alignment and go-to-market activities. The sales and marketing teams are strongly focused on
profitable revenue growth and business performance as well as on fostering demand, expanding the customer
base, maximizing market share, developing new product-roadmaps and providing the best technical support in
the field for our customers. The sales and marketing activities are supported by system marketing, product
marketing, application labs, field application engineers and quality engineers.

We engage distributors and sales representatives to distribute and promote our products around the world.
Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including those that compete with ours, and fulfill
orders and service many of our customers. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements
allowing for price protection and some with the right of return on unsold merchandise. Sales representatives, on
the other hand, generally do not offer products that compete directly with our products, but may carry
complementary items manufactured by others. Sales representatives do not maintain a product inventory and
their customers place large quantity orders directly with us and are referred to distributors for smaller orders.

At the request of certain customers, we also sell and deliver our products to electronics manufacturing
services (“EMS”) companies, which, on a contractual basis with our customers, incorporate our products into
the application specific products they manufacture for our customers.

In furtherance of our strong commitment to quality, our sales organizations include personnel dedicated to
close monitoring and resolution of quality related issues.

For a breakdown of net revenues by segment and geographic region for the last three fiscal years, see
“Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects”.

**Research and Development**

Since our formation, we have maintained a solid commitment to innovation. About one-sixth of our
employees work in R&D on product design/development and technology and, in 2019, we spent approximately
15.7% of our net revenues on R&D. Our innovations in semiconductor technology as well as in hardware and
software contribute to the creation of successful products that generate value for us and our customers. Our
complete design platforms, including a large selection of IP and silicon-proven models and design rules, enable
the fast development of products designed to meet customer expectations in terms of reliability, quality,
competitiveness in price and time-to-market. Through our R&D efforts, we contribute to making our
customers’ products more efficient, more appealing, more reliable and safer. Our technology R&D strategy is
based on the development of differentiated technologies, allowing for a unique offer in terms of new products
and enabling new applications opportunities.

(4) Our 300 mm fab is expanding capacity within the existing infrastructure to support the production ramp up of new technologies.

(5) Jointly owned with SHIC, a subsidiary of Shenzhen Electronics Group.

At December 31, 2019, our front-end facilities had a total maximum capacity of approximately 130,380
200 mm equivalent wafer starts per week. The number of wafer starts per week varies from facility to facility
and from period to period as a result of changes in product mix.

We own all of our manufacturing facilities, but certain facilities (Muar, Malaysia; Shenzhen, China; and
Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio, Singapore) are built on land subject of long-term leases.

We have historically subcontracted a portion of total manufacturing volumes to external suppliers. In
2019, we subcontracted approximately 18% of the value of our total silicon production to external foundries.
Our plan is to continue sourcing silicon from external foundries to give us flexibility in supporting our growth.

At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $514 million in outstanding commitments for purchases of
equipment and other assets for delivery in 2020. In 2019, our capital spending, net of proceeds, was $1,174
million compared to $1,262 million in 2018. In the 2017-2019 period the ratio of capital investment spending to
net revenues was about 13.6%. For more information, see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and
Prospects — Financial Outlook: Capital Investment”.

**Intellectual Property (IP)**

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents, licenses and other IP rights to protect our
proprietary technologies and processes. IP rights that apply to our various products include patents, copyrights,
trade secrets, trademarks and mask work rights. We currently own approximately 18,000 patents and pending
patent applications, corresponding to approximately 9,600 patent families (each patent family containing all
patents originating from the same invention), including over 588 original new patent applications filed in 2019.

We believe that our IP represents valuable assets. We rely on various intellectual property laws,
confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our IP assets and enforce our IP rights. To
optimize the value of our IP assets, we have engaged in licensing our design technology and other IP, including
patents, when consistent with our competitive position and our customers’ interests. We have also entered into
broad-scope cross-licenses and other agreements which enable us to design, manufacture and sell semiconductor
products using the IP rights of third parties and/or operating within the scope of IP rights owned by third parties.

From time to time, we are involved in IP litigation and infringement claims. See Note 26 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3. “Key Information — Risk Factors”. Regardless of the validity or
the successful assertion of such claims, we may incur significant costs with respect to the defense thereof, which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.

**Backlog**

Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders that are generally booked from one to
twelve months in advance of delivery. Quantities actually purchased by customers, as well as prices, are subject
to variations between booking and delivery and, in some cases, to cancellation due to changes in customer needs
or industry conditions. During periods of economic slowdown and/or industry overcapacity and/or declining
selling prices, customer orders are not generally made far in advance of the scheduled shipment date. Such
reduced lead time can diminish management’s ability to forecast production levels and revenues. When the
economy rebounds, our customers may strongly increase their demands, which can result in capacity constraints
due to a time lag when matching manufacturing capacity with such demand.

In addition, our sales are affected by seasonality, with the first quarter generally showing lowest revenue
levels in the year, and the third or fourth quarter historically generating higher amounts of revenues partly as a
result of the seasonal dynamics for smartphone applications dynamics

27

Table of Contents

We also sell certain products to key customers pursuant to frame contracts. Frame contracts are annual
contracts with customers setting forth quantities and prices on specific products that may be ordered in the
future. These contracts allow us to schedule production capacity in advance and allow customers to manage
their inventory levels consistent with just-in-time principles while shortening the cycle times required to
produce ordered products. Orders under frame contracts are also subject to a high degree of volatility, because
they reflect expected market conditions which may or may not materialize. Thus, they are subject to risks of
price reduction, order cancellation and modifications as to quantities actually ordered resulting in inventory
build-ups.

Furthermore, developing industry trends, including customers’ use of outsourcing and their deployment of
new and revised supply chain models, may reduce our ability to forecast changes in customer demand and may
increase our financial requirements in terms of capital expenditures and inventory levels.

We entered 2019 with a backlog lower than we had entering 2018. For 2020, we entered the year with a
backlog higher than what we had entering 2019.

**Competition**

Markets for our products are intensely competitive. We compete with major international semiconductor
companies and while only a few companies compete with us in all of our product lines, we face significant
competition from each of them. Smaller niche companies are also increasing their participation in the
semiconductor market, and semiconductor foundry companies have expanded significantly, particularly in Asia.
Competitors include manufacturers of standard semiconductors, ASICs and fully customized ICs, including both
chip and board-level products, as well as customers who develop their own IC products and foundry operations.
Some of our competitors are also our customers. We compete in different product lines to various degrees on
the basis of price, technical performance, product features, product system compatibility, customized design,
availability, quality and sales and technical support. In particular, standard products may involve greater risk of
competitive pricing, inventory imbalances and severe market fluctuations than differentiated products. Our
ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside our control, including successful and
timely development of new products and manufacturing processes, product performance and quality,
manufacturing yields and product availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic
trends.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by the high costs associated with developing marketable
products and manufacturing technologies as well as high levels of investment in production capabilities. As a
result, the semiconductor industry has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, significant
vertical and horizontal consolidation among our suppliers, competitors and customers, which could lead to
erosion of our market share, impact our capacity to compete and require us to restructure our operations. See
Item 3. “Key Information — Risk Factors”.

**Organizational Structure and History**

We are organized in a matrix structure with geographic regions interacting with product lines, both
supported by shared technology and manufacturing operations and by central functions, designed to enable us to
be closer to our customers and to facilitate communication among the R&D, production, marketing and sales
organizations.

While STMicroelectronics N.V. is the parent company, we conduct our global business through
STMicroelectronics International N.V. and also conduct our operations through service activities from our
subsidiaries. We provide certain administrative, human resources, legal, treasury, strategy, manufacturing,
marketing and other overhead services to our consolidated subsidiaries pursuant to service agreements for which
we recover the cost.

**Public Funding**

We receive public funding mainly from French, Italian and EU governmental entities. Such funding is
generally provided to encourage R&D activities, industrialization and local economic development. Public
funding in France, Italy and Europe generally is open to all companies, regardless of their ownership structure or
country of incorporation. The conditions for the receipt of government funding may include eligibility
restrictions, approval by EU authorities, annual budget appropriations, compliance with EU regulations,
royalties or contingent return provisions as well as specifications regarding objectives and results. The approval
process for such funding may be quite long, up to several years. Certain specific contracts require compliance
with extensive regulatory requirements and set forth certain conditions relating to the funded programs. There
could be penalties if these objectives are not fulfilled. Other contracts contain penalties for late deliveries or for
breach of contract, which may result in repayment obligations. Our funding programs are classified under three
general categories: funding for research and development activities, capital investment for pilot lines and loans.
We also benefit from tax credits for R&D activities in several countries which are generally available to all
companies. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects — Results of Operations” and the
Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The main programs for R&D in which we are involved include: (i) Pan-European program on
Nanoelectronics Technology and Applications (PENTA); (ii) EU R&D projects within Horizon 2020 (the
European Union’s research and innovation framework); (iii) Electronic Components and Systems for European
Leadership (ECSEL) initiative, which combines all electronics related R&D activities and is operated by joint
undertakings formed by the European Union, certain member states and industry; and (iv) national or regional
programs for R&D and for industrialization in the electronics industries involving many companies and
laboratories. The pan- European programs cover a period of several years, while national or regional programs
in France and Italy are subject mostly to annual budget appropriation.

In our role as Coordinator and Project Leader of Nano2017, we had been allocated an overall funding
budget of about €400 million for the period 2013-2018, which was subject to the conclusion of agreements
every year with the public authorities and linked to the achievement of technical parameters and objectives. A
portion of the Nano2017 program was subject to a payback clause (“financial return”), depending on the future
accumulated sales for certain products within the scope of the funded program in the period from 2018 to 2023.
The financial return corresponded to the payment in 2024 of the original funded amount (€37 million)
multiplied by a rate from 0% to 250%, depending on the cumulative amount of future sales. As such, the
criteria for granting income recognition were not met and an accrual amounting to $47 million was posted as of
December 31, 2019. We believe the Nano2017 R&D program, which expired in April 2018, has strengthened
our leadership in key technologies such as FD-SOI (low-power, high-performance processing), imagers, RF SOI
and photonic sensors and embedded non-volatile memories. These technologies are at the core of our digital
portfolio which includes, among others, microcontrollers, imaging, analog and mixed signal, digital automotive
and ASICs.

In December 2018, the European Commission announced the approval of Important Projects of Common
European Interest (“IPCEI”), a Pan-European project initiated to foster research and innovation in
microelectronics to be funded by Germany, France, Italy and the U.K. We are participating in IPCEI for the
period 2018 until 2022 in France and until 2024 in Italy. In 2019 we also started recognizing €49 million
(including catch up attributable to 2018) of grants related to our participation in IPCEI in Italy and €80.7 million
(including catch up attributable to 2018) related to our participation in IPCEI in France.

**Suppliers**

We use three primary critical types of suppliers in our business: (i) equipment suppliers, (ii) material
suppliers and (iii) external silicon foundries and back-end subcontractors. We also purchase third party licensed
technology from a limited number of providers.

In the front-end process, we use steppers, scanners, tracking equipment, strippers, chemo-mechanical
polishing equipment, cleaners, inspection equipment, etchers, physical and chemical vapor-deposition
equipment, implanters, furnaces, testers, probers and other specialized equipment. The manufacturing tools that
we use in the back-end process include bonders, burn-in ovens, testers and other specialized equipment. The
quality and technology of equipment used in the IC manufacturing process defines the limits of our technology.
Demand for increasingly smaller chip structures means that semiconductor producers must quickly incorporate
the latest advances in process technology to remain competitive. Advances in process technology cannot occur
without commensurate advances in equipment technology, and equipment costs tend to increase as the
equipment becomes more sophisticated.

Our manufacturing processes use many materials, including silicon and SiC wafers, lead frames, mold
compound, ceramic packages and chemicals and gases. The prices of many of these materials are volatile due to
the specificity of the market. We have therefore adopted a “multiple sourcing strategy” designed to protect us
from the risk of price increases. The same strategy applies to supplies for the materials used by us to avoid
potential material disruption of essential materials. Our “multiple sourcing strategy”, our Financial Risk
Monitoring as well as the robustness of our supply chain and strong partnership with suppliers are intended to
mitigate these risks. See Item 3. “Key Information — Risk Factors”.

Finally, we also use external subcontractors to outsource wafer manufacturing and assembly and testing of
finished products. See “— Property, Plants and Equipment” above.

**Environmental Matters**

We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the jurisdictions
where we operate. Such laws and regulations govern, among other things, the use, storage, discharge and
disposal of chemicals and other hazardous substances, emissions and wastes, as well as the investigation and
remediation of soil and ground water contamination. We are also required to obtain environmental permits,
licenses and other forms of authorization, or give prior notification, in order to operate.

We adopt a rigorous approach to managing our business operations in an environmentally responsible
way. Consistent with our sustainability strategy, we have established proactive environmental policies with
respect to the handling of chemicals, emissions, waste disposals and other substances of concern from our
manufacturing operations. We are certified to be in compliance with quality standard ISO 9001on a
Company-wide basis. We implement the highest standards across our manufacturing activities and supply
chain. The majority of our sites are ISO 14001 certified and EMAS validated. Furthermore, all of our front-end
manufacturing sites are ISO 50001 certified.

We believe that in 2019 our activities complied with then-applicable environmental regulations in all
material respects. We have engaged outside consultants to audit all of our environmental activities and have
created environmental management teams, information systems and training. We have also instituted
environmental control procedures for processes used by us as well as our suppliers. In 2019, there were no
material environmental claims made against us.

**Item 5.** **Operating and Financial Review and Prospects**

**Overview**

_The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and_
_Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 20-F. The following discussion contains statements of future_
_expectations and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of_
_1933, or Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, particularly in the sections “—_
_Critical Accounting Policies Using Significant Estimates”, “— Business Outlook”, “— Liquidity and Capital_
_Resources” and “— Financial Outlook: Capital Investment”. Our actual results may differ significantly from_
_those projected in the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that might cause future actual_
_results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements in_
_addition to the factors set forth below, see “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item_
_3. “Key Information — Risk Factors”. We assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or_
_such risk factors._

**Critical Accounting Policies Using Significant Estimates**

The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to
make estimates and assumptions. The primary areas that require significant estimates and judgments by us
include, but are not limited to:

-  sales returns and allowances;

-  inventory obsolescence reserves and normal manufacturing capacity thresholds to determine costs
capitalized in inventory;

-  recognition and measurement of loss contingencies;

-  valuation at fair value of assets acquired or sold, including intangibles, goodwill, investments and
tangible assets;

-  annual and trigger-based impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets, as well as the
assessment, in each reporting period, of events, which could trigger impairment testing on longlived assets;

-  recognition and measurement of restructuring charges and other related closure costs;

-  assumptions used in assessing the number of awards expected to vest on stock-based compensation
plans;

-  assumptions used in calculating pension obligations and other long-term employee benefits;

-  allocation between debt and equity of the various components of an issued, or converted, hybrid
instrument and measurement at fair value of the liability component based on a discount rate
adjustment technique income approach; and

-  determination of the amount of taxes expected to be paid and tax benefit expected to be received,
including deferred income tax assets, valuation allowance and provisions for uncertain tax positions
and claims.

We base the estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors such as
market trends, market information used by market participants and the latest available business plans that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. While we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions,
the actual results we experience could differ materially and adversely from our estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and
estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:

Table of Contents

_Revenue recognition. Arrangements with customers are considered contracts if all the following criteria_
are met: (a) parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations; (b)
each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified; (c) payment terms for the
goods or services to be transferred can be identified; (d) the contract has commercial substance and (e)
collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable. We recognize revenue from products sold to a
customer, including distributors, when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a
product to the customer. In certain circumstances, we may enter into agreements that concern principally
revenues from services, where the performance obligation is satisfied over time. The objective when allocating
the transaction price is to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation (or distinct good or
service) in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for
transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The payment terms typically range between 30 and
90 days. Certain of our customers require us to hold inventory as consignment in their hubs and only purchase
inventory when they require it. Revenue for sales of such inventory is recognized when, at the customer’s
option, the products are withdrawn from the consignment and we satisfy a performance obligation by
transferring control over a product to the customer.

Consistent with standard business practice in the semiconductor industry, price protection is granted to
distribution customers on their existing inventory of our products to compensate them for declines in market
prices. We accrue a provision for price protection based on a rolling historical price trend computed on a
monthly basis as a percentage of gross distributor sales. This historical price trend represents differences in
recent months between the invoiced price and the final price to the distributor, adjusted if required, to
accommodate a significant change in the current market price. The short outstanding inventory time period,
visibility into the inventory product pricing and long distributor pricing history have enabled us to reliably
estimate price protection provisions at period-end. We record the accrued amounts as a deduction of “Net sales”
in the consolidated statements of income at the time of the sale.

Our customers occasionally return our products for technical reasons. Our standard terms and conditions
of sale provide that if we determine that products do not conform, we will repair or replace the non-conforming
products, or issue a credit note or rebate of the purchase price. Quality returns are identified shortly after sale in
customer quality control testing. Quality returns are usually associated with end-user customers, not with
distribution channels. We record the accrued amounts as a deduction of “Net sales” in the consolidated
statements of income, using past history and current conditions to form a reasonable estimate of future returns.

Our insurance policy relating to product liability covers third party physical damages and bodily injury,
indirect financial damages as well as immaterial non-consequential damages caused by defective products. We
record a provision for warranty costs as a charge against “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of
income, based on historical trends of warranty costs incurred as a percentage of sales, which management had
determined to be a reasonable estimate of the probable losses to be incurred for warranty claims in a period.
Any potential warranty claims are subject to our determination that we are at fault for damages, and that such
claims usually must be submitted within a short period of time following the date of sale. This warranty is given
in lieu of all other warranties, conditions or terms expressed or implied by statute or common law. Our
contractual terms and conditions typically limit our liability to the sales value of the products that gave rise to
the claims.

In addition to product sales, we enter into arrangements with customers consisting in transferring licenses
or related to license services. The revenue generated from these arrangements are reported on the line “Other
revenues” of the consolidated statement of income. Other revenues also include patent royalty income, sale of
scrap materials and manufacturing by-products.

_Trade_ _accounts_ _receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting_
from our customers’ inability to make required payments. In addition, we record an allowance for any specific
account we consider as doubtful. In 2019, we did not record any new material specific charge related to
doubtful customers. If we receive information that the financial condition of our customers has deteriorated,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.

_Business_ _combinations_ _and_ _goodwill. The acquisition method of accounting applied to business_
combinations requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value
of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the
purchase price are not correct or if business conditions change, purchase price adjustments or future asset
impairment charges could be required. At December 31, 2019, the value of goodwill in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet amounted to $162 million.

_Impairment_ _of_ _goodwill. Goodwill recognized in business combinations is not amortized but is tested for_
impairment annually as of the end of the third quarter, or more frequently if a triggering event indicating a
possible impairment exists. Goodwill subject to potential impairment is tested at a reporting unit level. This
impairment test determines whether the fair value of each reporting unit for which goodwill is allocated is lower
than the total carrying amount of relevant net assets allocated to such reporting unit, including its allocated
goodwill. If lower, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value
of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recognized for any excess in the consolidated statements of income
on the line “Impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs”. Significant management
judgments and estimates are used in forecasting the future discounted cash flows associated with the reporting
unit, including: the applicable industry’s sales volume forecast and selling price evolution, the reporting unit’s
market penetration and its revenues evolution, the market acceptance of certain new technologies and products,
the relevant cost structure, the discount rates applied using a weighted average cost of capital and the perpetuity
rates used in calculating cash flow terminal values. Our evaluations are based on financial plans updated with
the latest available projections of the semiconductor market, our sales expectations and our costs evaluation, and
are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the
plans and estimates used may prove to be incorrect, and future adverse changes in market conditions, changes in
strategies, lack of performance of major customers or operating results of acquired businesses that are not in line
with our estimates may require impairments.

We performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of the end of the third quarters of 2019, 2018
and 2017 and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment loss. Impairment charges could result from new
valuations triggered by changes in our product portfolio or strategic alternatives, particularly in the event of a
downward shift in future revenues or operating cash flows in relation to our current plans or in case of capital
injections by, or equity transfers to, third parties at a value lower than the current carrying value.

_Intangible assets_ _subject_ _to_ _amortization. Intangible assets subject to amortization include intangible_
assets purchased from third parties recorded at cost and intangible assets acquired in business combinations
recorded at fair value, comprised of technologies and licenses, and computer software. Intangible assets with
finite useful lives are reflected net of any impairment losses and are amortized over their estimated useful lives.
Amortization begins when the intangible asset is available for use and is calculated using the straight-line
method to allocate the cost of the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. The carrying value of
intangible assets with finite useful lives is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of
income on the line “Impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs” for the amount by which
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset at
each reporting date to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of
amortization. Our evaluations are based on financial plans updated with the latest available projections of
growth in the semiconductor market and our sales expectations. They are consistent with the plans and
estimates that we use to manage our business. It is possible, however, that the plans and estimates used may be
incorrect and that future adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of businesses acquired may
not be in line with our estimates and may therefore require us to recognize impairment charges on certain
intangible assets.

In 2019 and 2018, respectively, we recorded a $4 million and $2 million impairment charge on acquired
licenses and technologies for which it was determined that they had no future alternative use. During 2017, we
did not record any impairment charges on intangible assets.

We will continue to monitor the carrying value of our assets. If market conditions deteriorate, this could
result in future non-cash impairment charges against earnings. Further impairment charges could also result
from new valuations triggered by changes in our product portfolio or by strategic transactions, particularly in the
event of a downward shift in future revenues or operating cash flows in relation to our current plans or in case of
capital injections by, or equity transfers to, third parties at a value lower than the one underlying the carrying
amount.

At December 31, 2019, the value of intangible assets subject to amortization in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet amounted to $299 million.

_Property, plant_ _and_ _equipment. Our business requires substantial investments in technologically_
advanced manufacturing facilities, which may become significantly underutilized or obsolete as a result of rapid
changes in demand and ongoing technological evolution. We estimate the useful life for the majority of our
manufacturing equipment, the largest component of our long-lived assets, to be six years, except for our 300
mm manufacturing equipment whose useful life is estimated to be ten years. This estimate is based on our
experience using the equipment over time. Depreciation expense is an important element of our manufacturing
cost structure. We begin to depreciate newly acquired equipment when it is placed into service.

We evaluate each period whether there is reason to suspect that tangible assets or groups of assets held
and used might not be recoverable. Several impairment indicators exist for making this assessment, such as:
restructuring plans, significant changes in the technology, market, economic or legal environment in which we
operate, available evidence of obsolescence of the asset, or indication that its economic performance is, or will
be, worse than expected. In determining the recoverability of assets to be held and used, we initially assess
whether the carrying value of the tangible assets or group of assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows
associated with these assets. If exceeded, we then evaluate whether an impairment charge is required by
determining if the asset’s carrying value also exceeds its fair value. We normally estimate this fair value based
on independent market appraisals or the sum of discounted future cash flows, using market assumptions such as
the utilization of our fabrication facilities and the ability to upgrade such facilities, change in the selling price
and the adoption of new technologies. We also evaluate and adjust, if appropriate, the assets’ useful lives at
each reporting date or when impairment indicators are identified. Assets classified as held for sale are reported
as current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. In 2019, we impaired $3 million of long-lived assets. In 2018 and
2017, no impairment charge was recorded on property, plant and equipment. The impairment on the assets held
for sale was nil for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Our evaluations are based on financial plans updated with the latest projections of growth in the
semiconductor market and our sales expectations, from which we derive the future production needs and loading
of our manufacturing facilities, and which are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our
business. These plans are highly variable due to the high volatility of the semiconductor business and therefore
are subject to continuous modifications. If future growth differs from the estimates used in our plans, in terms
of both market growth and production allocation to our manufacturing plants, this could require a further review
of the carrying amount of our tangible assets and result in a potential impairment loss.

_Inventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is based on the weighted_
average cost by adjusting the standard cost to approximate actual manufacturing costs on a quarterly basis;
therefore, the cost is dependent on our manufacturing performance. In the case of underutilization of our
manufacturing facilities, we estimate the costs associated with the unused capacity. These costs are not included
in the valuation of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable
costs of completion, disposal and transportation.

We perform, on a continuous basis, inventory write-offs of products, which have the characteristics of
slow-moving, old production dates and technical obsolescence. The valuation of inventory requires us to
estimate a reserve for obsolete or slow-selling inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality.
Reserve for obsolescence is estimated for excess uncommitted inventories based on the previous quarters’ sales,
order backlog and production plans. To the extent that future negative market conditions generate order backlog
cancellations and declining sales, or if future conditions are less favorable than the projected revenue
assumptions, we could record additional inventory reserve, which would have a negative impact on our gross
margin.

_Restructuring charges. We have undertaken, and we may continue to undertake, significant restructuring_
initiatives, which have required us, or may require us in the future, to develop formalized plans for exiting any
of our existing activities. We recognize the fair value of a liability for costs associated with exiting an activity
when we have a present obligation and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Given the significance and
timing of the execution of our restructuring activities, the process is complex and involves periodic reviews of
estimates made at the time the original decisions were taken. This process can require a significant amount of
time due to requisite governmental and customer approvals and our capability to transfer technology and knowhow to other locations. As we operate in a highly cyclical industry, we monitor and evaluate business
conditions on a regular basis. If broader or newer initiatives, which could include production curtailment or
closure of other manufacturing facilities, were to be taken, we may incur additional charges as well as change
estimates of the amounts previously recorded. The potential impact of these changes could be material and
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In 2019 the restructuring
charges and other related closure costs were nil. In 2018 and 2017, the restructuring charges and other related
closure costs amounted to $19 million and $45 million before taxes, respectively, mainly in connection with our
set-top box restructuring plan.

_Share-based_ _compensation. We measure the cost of share-based service awards based on the fair value of_
the awards as of the grant date reflecting the market price of the underlying shares at the date of the grant,
reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the requisite service
period. Our share-based service awards are granted to senior executives and selected employees. While the
awards granted to selected employees are subject to a three-year service period, the awards granted to the senior
executives are subject to both a three-year service period and the fulfillment of certain performance conditions,
including our financial results when compared to industry performance. The expense is recognized over the
requisite service period. In 2019, approximately one-half of the total amount of shares awarded were granted to
senior executives and consequently were contingent on the achievement of performance conditions. In order to
determine share-based compensation to be recorded for the period, we use significant estimates on the number
of awards expected to vest, including the probability of achieving the fixed performance conditions including
those relating to industry performance compared to our financial results, and our best estimates of award
forfeitures and employees’ service periods. Our assumptions related to industry performance are generally
taken with a one quarter lag in line with the availability of market information. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we
recorded a total charge of approximately $145 million, $125 million and $61 million relating to our outstanding
stock award plans, respectively.

_Financial assets. We classify our financial assets in the following two categories, trading and available-_
for-sale. The classification depends on the nature of the instruments and the purpose for which the financial
assets were acquired. We determine the classification of our financial assets at initial recognition. Purchases
and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date - the date on which we commit to purchase or sell
the asset. Equity securities are measured at fair value through earnings and debt securities classified as
available-for-sale are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets are
derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred
and we have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership; the relevant gain (loss) is reported as a
non-operating element on the consolidated statements of income on the line “Gain (loss) on financial
instruments, net”. The basis on which the cost of a security sold and the amount reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income into earnings, if any, are determined is the specific identification method.

The fair values of quoted debt and equity securities are based on current market prices. If the market for a
financial asset is not active and if no observable market price is obtainable, we measure fair value by using
assumptions and estimates. In measuring fair value, we make maximum use of market inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs.

_Income_ _taxes. We make estimates and judgments in determining income tax for the period, comprising_
current and deferred income tax. We assess the income tax expected to be paid or the tax benefit expected to be
received related to the current year taxable profit and loss in each individual tax jurisdiction and recognize
deferred income tax for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying amount in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Furthermore, at each reporting date, we assess all
material open income tax positions in all tax jurisdictions to determine any uncertain tax positions which would
require a provision for the amount of income tax benefits that we do not expect to reasonably sustain. As of
December 31, 2019, we had $48 million of estimated liabilities on uncertain tax positions.

36

Table of Contents

We also assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets. Their ultimate realization is
dependent upon, among other things, our ability to generate future taxable profit available, or tax credits before
their expiration, or our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax optimization strategies, or the possibility to
settle uncertain tax positions against available net operating loss carry forwards, or similar tax losses and credits.
We record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets when we consider it is more likely than not that
the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

As of December 31, 2019, we had non-current deferred tax assets of $695 million, net of valuation
allowances.

We could be required to record further valuation allowances thereby reducing the amount of total deferred
tax assets, resulting in an increase of our income tax charge, if our estimates of projected future taxable income
and benefits from available tax strategies are reduced as a result of a change in business conditions or in
management’s plans or due to other factors, or if changes in current tax regulations are enacted that impose
restrictions on the timing or extent of our ability to utilize net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards in
the future. Likewise, a change in the tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions or unfavorable outcomes of
any ongoing tax audits could have a material impact on our future tax provisions in the periods in which these
changes could occur.

_Pension_ _and_ _Post-Employment_ _Benefits. Our Consolidated Statements of Income and our Consolidated_
Balance Sheets include amounts for pension obligations and post-employment benefits that are measured using
actuarial valuations. At December 31, 2019, our pension and post-employment benefit obligations net of plan
assets amounted to $455 million. These valuations are based on key assumptions, including discount rates,
expected long-term rates of return on funds, turnover rates and salary increase rates. These assumptions used in
the determination of the net periodic benefit cost are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal
year or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. Any changes in the pension schemes or in
the above assumptions can have an impact on our valuations. The measurement date we use for our plans is
December 31.

_Patent_ _and_ _other_ _Intellectual_ _Property (“IP”) litigation_ _or_ _claims. We record a provision when we believe_
that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate losses and claims to determine whether
they need to be adjusted based on current information available to us. Such estimates are difficult to the extent
that they are largely dependent on the status of ongoing litigation that may vary based on positions taken by the
court with respect to issues submitted, demands of opposing parties, changing laws, discovery of new facts or
other matters of fact or law. As of December 31, 2019, based on our current evaluation of ongoing litigation
and claims we face, we have not estimated any amounts that could have a material impact on our results of
operations and financial condition with respect to either probable or possible risks. In the event of litigation that
is adversely determined with respect to our interests, or in the event that we need to change our evaluation of a
potential third-party claim based on new evidence, facts or communications, unexpected rulings or changes in
the law, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition at the time it
were to materialize. We are in discussion with several parties with respect to claims against us relating to
possible infringement of IP rights. We are also involved in certain legal proceedings concerning such issues.
See “Item 8. Financial Information — Legal Proceedings” and Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

_Other_ _claims. We are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of_
business. These include but are not limited to: warranty costs on our products not covered by insurance, breach
of contract claims, tax claims beyond assessed uncertain tax positions as well as claims for environmental
damages. We are also exposed to numerous legal risks which until now have not resulted in legal disputes and
proceedings. These include risks related to product recalls, environment, anti-trust, anti-corruption and
competition as well as other compliance regulations. We may also face claims in the event of breaches of law
committed by individual employees or third parties. In determining loss contingencies, we consider the
likelihood of a loss of an asset or the occurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the
amount of such loss or liability. An estimated loss is recorded when we believe that it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly re-evaluate any losses
and claims and determine whether our provisions need to be adjusted based on the current information available
to us. As of December 31, 2019, based on our current evaluation of ongoing litigation and claims we face, we
have not estimated any amounts that could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial
condition with respect to either probable or possible risks. In the event we are unable to accurately estimate the
amount of such loss in a correct and timely manner, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations or financial condition at the time such loss was to materialize. For further details of our legal
proceedings refer to “Item 8. Financial Information — Legal Proceedings” and Note 26 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

**_Fiscal Year 2019_**

Under Article 35 of our Articles of Association, our financial year extends from January 1 to December
31, which is the period end of each fiscal year. In 2019, the first quarter ended on March 30, the second quarter
ended on June 29, the third quarter ended on September 28 and the fourth quarter ended on December 31. In
2020, the first quarter will end on March 28, the second quarter will end on June 27, the third quarter will end on
September 26 and the fourth quarter will end on December 31. Based on our fiscal calendar, the distribution of
our revenues and expenses by quarter may be unbalanced due to a different number of days in the various
quarters of the fiscal year and can also differ from equivalent prior years’ periods, as illustrated in the below
table for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Based on industry data published by WSTS, semiconductor industry revenues in 2019 decreased on a
year-over-year basis by approximately 12% for the TAM, while it remains substantially flat for the SAM, to
reach approximately $412 billion and $194 billion, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2019, on a year-overyear basis, the TAM decreased by approximately 6%, while the SAM increased by approximately 2%.
Sequentially, the TAM increased by approximately 1%, while the SAM decreased by approximately 3%.

Our 2019 financial performance, with net revenues of $9.56 billion, gross margin of 38.7% and operating
margin of 12.6% is aligned with the full year expectations we provided in April 2019.

We closed 2019 with a solid fourth quarter sales and financial performance. In the fourth quarter, net
revenues were up 4.0% year-over-year, gross margin reached 39.3%, and operating margin was 16.7%. On a
sequential basis, fourth quarter revenues grew by 7.9%, with all product group contributing to the growth, and
290 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance. Our quarterly performance was above the SAM both
sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.

Our effective average exchange rate was $1.14 for €1.00 for the full year 2019, as compared to $1.18 for
€1.00 for the full year 2018. Our effective average exchange rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.12 for
€1.00, compared to $1.14 for €1.00 for the third quarter of 2019 and $1.17 for €1.00 in the fourth quarter of
2018. For a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements and the impact of fluctuations in exchange
rates, see “Impact of Changes in Exchange Rates”.

Our 2019 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 38.7% from 40.0% in 2018 mainly due to normal
price pressure and increased unsaturation charges, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies,
better product mix, and favorable currency effects, net of hedging.

Our fourth quarter 2019 gross margin was 39.3%, 110 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance,
improving sequentially by 140 basis points, mainly driven by improved product mix and better manufacturing
efficiencies. Our gross margin decreased 70 basis points year-over-year, mainly impacted by price pressure and
unsaturation charges, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies, better product mix and favorable
currency effects, net of hedging.

Our operating expenses, comprised of SG&A and R&D expenses, amounted to $2,591 million in 2019,
increasing by about 3.9% from $2,493 million in the prior year, mainly due to salary dynamic, increased
spending in certain R&D programs and higher share-based compensation cost, partially offset by favorable
currency effects, net of hedging. Combined R&D and SG&A expenses were $672 million for the fourth quarter
of 2019, compared to $629 million and $630 million in the prior and year-ago quarters, respectively. The
sequential increase was mainly due to seasonality and salary dynamic. The year-over-year increase of operating
expenses was mainly due to salary dynamic and increased activity on certain R&D programs, and was partially
offset by favorable currency effects, net of hedging.

Other income and expenses, net, was $103 million in 2019 compared to $53 million in 2018, mainly due
to a higher level of R&D grants, mainly benefitting from the grants associated with the programs part of the
European Commission IPCEI in Italy and in France. Fourth quarter other income and expenses, net, was $54
million compared to negative $2 million in the prior quarter and $16 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting
higher R&D grants in Italy associated with the IPCEI program.

In 2019, impairment and restructuring charges were $5 million compared to $21 million in 2018.
Impairment and restructuring charges in the fourth quarter were $3 million compared to nil in the prior quarter
and $2 million in the year-ago quarters.

Operating income in 2019 was $1,203 million, decreasing by $197 million compared to 2018, mainly
driven by normal price pressure, increased unsaturation charges and higher R&D spending, partially offset by
higher level of grants and favorable currency effects, net of hedging. Operating income in the fourth quarter
grew on a sequential and year-over-year basis to $460 million compared to $336 million and $443 million in the
prior quarter and year-ago quarters, respectively, mainly driven by higher revenues, improved product mix and a
higher level of grants.

Full year 2019 net income was $1,032 million, or $1.14 diluted earnings per share, compared to net
income of $1,287 million, or $1.41 diluted earnings per share for the full year 2018. Fourth quarter net income
increased on a sequential basis and decreased on a year-over-year basis to $392 million, or $0.43 diluted
earnings per share, compared to net income of $302 million, or $0.34 diluted earnings per share, in the prior
quarter, and a net income of $418 million, or $0.46 diluted earnings per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Capital expenditure payments, net of proceeds from sales, were $236 million and $1.17 billion during the
fourth quarter and full year 2019, respectively. Full year 2018 capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales,
were $1.26 billion.

During 2019, our net cash increased by $341 million, with net cash from operating activities reaching
$1.87 billion. During 2019, we paid $127 million for the acquisition of Norstel, $214 million of cash dividends
to shareholders, $144 million for long-term debt repayment and $250 million for the repurchase of common
stock.

Our free cash flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, amounted to $497 million in 2019 compared to $533
million in 2018. Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for the reconciliation of the free cash flow, a nonU.S. GAAP measure, to our cash flow statement.

**_Business Outlook_**

Our first quarter 2020 outlook reflects revenues of approximately $2.36 billion at the mid-point,
increasing year-over-year by about 13.7%. Sequentially, this represents a decrease of approximately 14.3%,
plus or minus 350 basis points. Gross margin is expected to be at approximately 38.0%, plus or minus 200 basis
points, including 80 basis points of unsaturation charges. For 2020, we plan our capital investment at
approximately $1.5 billion to support our strategic initiatives and revenue growth and to achieve our mid-term
revenue target of $12 billion.

_This outlook is based on an assumed effective currency exchange rate of approximately $1.12 = €1.00 for_
_the 2020 first quarter and includes the impact of existing hedging contracts. The first quarter will close on_
_March 28, 2020._

_These are forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that_
_could cause actual results to differ materially; in particular, refer to those known risks and uncertainties_
_described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 3. Key Information — Risk_
_Factors” herein._

**_Other Developments_**

On January 15, 2020, we announced the signing of a multi-year silicon carbide (SiC) wafers supply
agreement with SiCrystal, a ROHM group company. The agreement governs the supply of over $120 million of
advanced 150 mm silicon carbide wafers by SiCrystal to us during this period of demand ramp-up for silicon
carbide power devices.

In December 2019, our President, Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility, Mr. Philippe
Brun left the Company.

On December 2, 2019, we announced the closing of the full acquisition of Swedish SiC wafer
manufacturer Norstel AB (“Norstel”). We exercised our option to acquire the remaining 45% share capital,
[following the initial transaction with respect to the acquisition of 55% of Norstel’s share capital as previously](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LQ1_q0lBq7i9tuQdicKrTLM5D56UZQKOzyjkGj0AltRmrh02xpKCnitGE-L055Q_E3Stotcyly8RW0SW7YZzWLycem6KvDWnJaNZ2LodIMor7AC-oAlvXsKqHWs6gWxYNibdgJGs3_uMQYwLZj6FtEef91Qru1_gUJ7vL4-70Do=)
announced on February 7, 2019. The total consideration for the acquisition of Norstel was $137.5 million,
funded with available cash.

On November 19, 2019 we announced the expansion and extension of an existing multi-year, long-term
SiC wafer supply agreement with Cree, Inc (“Cree”) to more than $500 million. The extended agreement is a
doubling in value of the original January 7, 2019 agreement for the supply of Cree’s advanced 150 mm silicon
carbide bare and epitaxial wafers over the next several years. The increased wafer supply enables the
semiconductor leaders to address the rapidly growing demand for silicon carbide power devices globally,
particularly in automotive and industrial applications.

On August 21, 2019 we published our IFRS 2019 Semi Annual Accounts for the six-month period ended
June 29, 2019 on our website and filed them with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets
(Autoriteit Financiële Markten).

On May 23, 2019 we announced that all of the proposed resolutions were adopted at the Company's

**_Results of Operations_**

**Segment Information**

We design, develop, manufacture and market a broad range of products, including discrete and standard
commodity components, application-specific integrated circuits, full-custom devices and semi-custom devices
and application-specific standard products for analog, digital and mixed-signal applications. In addition, we
further participate in the manufacturing value chain of Smartcard products, which includes the production and
sale of both silicon chips and Smartcards.

Our reportable segments are as follows:

-  _Automotive_ _and_ _Discrete_ _Group_ _(ADG), comprised of dedicated automotive ICs (both digital and_
analog), and discrete and power transistor products for all market segments.

-  _Analog, MEMS_ _and Sensors Group_ _(AMS), comprised of low-power high-end analog ICs (both_
custom and general purpose) for all markets, smart power products for Industrial, Computer and
personal electronics markets, Touch Screen Controllers, Low Power Connectivity solutions (both
wireline and wireless) for IoT, power conversion products, metering solutions for Smart Grid,
specialized imaging sensors and modules, and all MEMS products for sensors or Actuators.

-  _Microcontrollers_ _and_ _Digital_ _ICs_ _Group_ _(MDG), comprised of general purpose and secure_
microcontrollers, EEPROM memories, Digital ASICs, Aerospace and Defense products including
components for microwave and millimeter wave.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Subsystems business unit was transferred from Others to AMS. Prior
periods have been restated accordingly.

For the computation of the segments’ internal financial measurements, we use certain internal rules of
allocation for the costs not directly chargeable to the segments, including cost of sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses and a part of research and development expenses. In compliance with our internal
policies, certain costs are not allocated to the segments, but reported in “Others” and include impairment,
restructuring charges and other related closure costs, management reorganization expenses, unused capacity
charges, phase-out and start-up costs of certain manufacturing facilities, certain one-time corporate items,
strategic and special research and development programs or other corporate-sponsored initiatives, including
certain corporate-level operating expenses, patent claims and litigations and certain other miscellaneous charges.
In addition, depreciation and amortization expense is part of the manufacturing costs allocated to the segments
and is neither identified as part of the inventory variation nor as part of the unused capacity charges; therefore, it
cannot be isolated in the costs of goods sold. Finally, R&D grants are allocated to our segments proportionally
to the incurred R&D expenses on the sponsored projects.

Wafer costs are allocated to the segments based on actual cost. From time to time, with respect to specific
technologies, wafer costs are allocated to segments based on market price.

In 2019 we recognized other income, net of expenses, of $103 million, increasing compared to $53
million in 2018, mainly benefitting from the grants associated with the programs part of the European
Commission IPCEI in Italy and in France, partially offset by a higher level of start-up costs associated with the
production ramp up of the 200 mm fab recently acquired from Micron Technology Inc. in Singapore.

In 2018 we recognized other income, net of expenses, of $53 million, slightly decreasing compared to $55
million in 2017, mainly due to lower level of R&D grants.

closure costs $ (5) $ (21) $ (45)

In 2019 we recorded $5 million of impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs,
mainly consisting of impairment of equipment and licenses dedicated exclusively to certain development
projects that were cancelled, while no alternative future use was identified internally.

In 2018 we recorded $21 million of impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs,
consisting of: (i) $19 million related to the set-top box restructuring plan and (ii) $2 million of impairment of
acquired technologies, for which it was determined that they had no future alternative use.

In 2017 we recorded $45 million of impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs,
primarily consisting of: (i) $34 million of net restructuring charges related to the set-top box restructuring plan;
(ii) $13 million of restructuring charges related to the restructuring plan in Bouskoura, Morocco; (iii) $3 million
charge relating to the update of the existing unused lease provision and (iv) $5 million income for the reversal of
provisions related to previously announced restructuring plans, mainly the Embedded Processing Solutions
business restructuring plan, for which accrued provisions were not fully used at completion of the plan.

Operating income in 2019 was $1,203 million, decreasing by $197 million compared to 2018, reflecting
normal price pressure, increased unsaturation charges and higher R&D spending, partially offset by higher level
of grants and favorable currency effects, net of hedging.

Operating income in 2018 was $1,400 million, improved by $395 million compared to 2017, reflecting
higher volumes, improved manufacturing efficiencies and product mix and lower restructuring charges, partially
offset by unfavorable currency effects, net of hedging, normal price pressure and higher operating expenses.

In 2019, interest expense and fees on our borrowings and our committed credit facilities amounted to $54
million, of which $37 million was a non-cash interest expense resulting from the accretion of the discount on the
liability component of our dual tranche senior unsecured convertible bonds issued in 2017. In 2019, the interest
expense was more than offset by $55 million of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities.

In 2019, the effective tax rate was 13%, including $24 million of tax benefit, mainly due to the revaluation
of deferred tax assets and following the enactment of the Swiss tax reform which cancelled all favorable tax
regimes and introduced a single tax rate for all companies.

In 2018, the effective tax rate was 7%, including $12 million of tax benefit from discrete items mainly due
to settlement of local tax assessment.

In 2017, the effective tax rate was 15% and included the one-time impact related to the change in enacted
income tax rate impacting deferred taxes, mainly in the United States for an amount of $46 million, reflecting
the impact on deferred tax assets of the reduction of corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% enacted with the U.S.
tax reform in December 2017.

Our tax rate is variable and depends on changes in the level of operating results within various local
jurisdictions and on changes in the applicable taxation rates of these jurisdictions, as well as changes in
estimations of our tax provisions. Our income tax amounts and rates depend also on our loss carry-forwards and
their relevant valuation allowances, which are based on estimated projected plans and available tax optimization
strategies; in the case of material changes in these plans, the valuation allowances could be adjusted accordingly
with an impact on our tax charges. We currently enjoy certain tax benefits in some countries. Such benefits
may not be available in the future due to changes in the local jurisdictions; our effective tax rate could be
different in future periods and may increase in the coming years. In addition, our yearly income tax charges
include the estimated impact of provisions related to tax positions which have been considered uncertain.

**Quarterly Results of Operations**

Certain quarterly financial information for the years 2019 and 2018 are set forth below. Such information
is derived from our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared on a basis consistent with the
Consolidated Financial Statements that include, in our opinion, all normal adjustments necessary for a fair
statement of the interim information set forth therein. Operating results for any quarter are not necessarily
indicative of results for any future period. In addition, in view of the significant volatility we have experienced
in recent years, the increasingly competitive nature of the markets in which we operate, the changes in products
mix and the currency effects of changes in the composition of sales and production among different geographic
regions, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an
indication of future performance.

Our quarterly and annual operating results are also affected by a wide variety of other factors that could
materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability or lead to significant variability of operating results,
please see “Item 3. Key Information — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Operations”. As only a portion of
our expenses varies with our revenues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce costs promptly
or adequately in relation to revenue declines to compensate for the effect of any such factors. As a result,
unfavorable changes in the above or other factors have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our
operating results. Quarterly results have also been and may be expected to continue to be substantially affected
by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and electronic systems industries, the speed of some process and
manufacturing technology developments, market demand for existing products, the timing and success of new
product introductions and the levels of provisions and other unusual charges incurred. Certain additions of our
quarterly results will not total our annual results due to rounding.

Our fourth quarter 2019 net revenues amounted to $2,754 million, registering a sequential increase of
7.9%, 290 basis points above the mid-point of our guidance, with all product groups contributing to the growth.
The sequential increase resulted from higher volumes of approximately 7% and an increase of approximately
1% in average selling prices, the latter entirely due to product mix, while selling prices remained substantially
stable.

On a year-over-year basis, our net revenues increased by 4.0%. This increase was entirely due to an
increase of approximately 6% in average selling prices, partially offset by an approximate 2% decrease in
volumes. The average selling prices increase was entirely driven by improved product mix of approximately
9%, partially offset by lower selling prices of approximately 3%.

On a sequential basis, ADG revenues were up 3.3%, driven by an increase in volumes of approximately
8%, partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of approximately 5%, mostly attributable to product
mix. AMS revenues increased 12.1% driven by Analog and Imaging products. AMS increase was due to an
increase of approximately 5% in average selling prices, entirely due to product mix, and to higher volumes of
approximately of 7%. MDG revenues increased by 7.9%, mainly driven by Microcontrollers, due to both higher
average selling prices of approximately 6%, entirely due to product mix, and higher volumes of approximately
2%.

On a year-over-year basis, fourth quarter net revenues increased by 4.0%. ADG revenues decreased 4.5%
compared to the year-ago quarter on lower revenues in both Automotive and Power Discrete. The decrease was
entirely due to lower average selling prices of approximately 4%, while volumes remained substantially flat.
The decrease in average selling prices was a combination of less favorable product mix and lower selling prices.
AMS fourth quarter revenues grew 9.9% year-over-year, mainly driven by Analog and Imaging. The increase
was entirely due to higher average selling prices of approximately 18%, entirely attributable to product mix,
partially offset by lower volumes of approximately 8%. MDG fourth quarter revenues increased by 7.6%,
mainly driven by Microcontrollers. The increase was due to higher average selling prices of approximately 9%,
entirely due to improved product mix.

margin increased 140 basis points, mainly driven by improved product mix and better manufacturing
efficiencies.

Gross margin decreased 70 basis points year-over-year, mainly impacted by price pressure and
unsaturation charges, partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies, better product mix and favorable
currency effects, net of hedging.

The amount of our operating expenses increased by $43 million on a sequential basis, mainly driven by
seasonality and salary dynamic.

On a year-over-year basis, our operating expenses increased by $42 million, mainly due to salary dynamic
and increased spending on certain R&D programs, partially offset by favorable currency effects, net of hedging.

Fourth quarter 2019 R&D expenses were net of research tax credits in France and Italy, which amounted
to $37 million, compared to $29 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $39 million in the fourth quarter of
2018.

Table of Contents

Our principal strategy to reduce the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations has been to balance as
much as possible the proportion of sales to our customers denominated in U.S. dollars with the amount of
materials, purchases and services from our suppliers denominated in U.S. dollars, thereby reducing the potential
exchange rate impact of certain variable costs relative to revenues. Moreover, in order to further reduce the
exposure to U.S. dollar exchange fluctuations, we have hedged certain line items on our Consolidated
Statements of Income, in particular with respect to a portion of the costs of sales, most of the R&D expenses and
certain SG&A expenses, located in the Euro zone, which we account for as cash flow hedging contracts. We
use two different types of hedging contracts: forward and options (including collars).

Our Consolidated Statements of Income included income and expense items translated at the average U.S.
dollar exchange rate for the period, plus the impact of the hedging contracts expiring during the period. Our
effective average exchange rate was $1.14 for €1.00 for the full year 2019 and $1.18 for €1.00 for the full year
2018. Our effective exchange rate was $1.12 for €1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2019, $1.14 for €1.00 for the
third quarter of 2019 and $1.17 for €1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2018. These effective exchange rates reflect
the actual exchange rates combined with the impact of cash flow hedging contracts that matured in the period.

The time horizon of our cash flow hedging for manufacturing costs and operating expenses may run up to
24 months, for a limited percentage of our exposure to the Euro, depending on currency market circumstances.
As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding hedged amounts were €642 million to cover manufacturing costs and
€446 million to cover operating expenses, both at an average exchange rate of about $1.16 to €1.00 (considering
the collars at upper strike), maturing over the period from January 6, 2020 to April 9, 2021. As of December 31,
2019, measured in respect to the exchange rate at period closing of about $1.12 to €1.00, these outstanding
hedging contracts and certain expiring contracts covering manufacturing expenses capitalized in inventory
resulted in a deferred loss of approximately $4 million before tax, recorded in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)” in the Consolidated Statements of Equity, compared to a deferred loss of
approximately $38 million before tax at December 31, 2018, recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss)” in the Consolidated Statements of Equity.

We also hedge certain manufacturing costs denominated in Singapore dollars (SGD); as of December 31,
2019, the outstanding hedged amounts were SGD 143 million at an average exchange rate of about SGD 1.36 to
$1.00 maturing over the period from January 9, 2020 to November 27, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, these
outstanding hedging contracts resulted in $1 million deferred gain, compared to a deferred loss of approximately
$1 million before tax at December 31, 2018, recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in
the Consolidated Statements of Equity.

Our cash flow hedging policy is not intended to cover our full exposure and is based on hedging a
declining portion of our exposure in the next four quarters. In 2019, as a result of our cash flow hedging, we
recorded a net loss of $79 million, consisting of a loss of about $51 million to cost of sales, a loss of $22 million
to research and development and a loss of $6 million to selling, general and administrative, while in 2018, we
recorded a net profit of $1 million.

In addition to our cash flow hedging, in order to mitigate potential exchange rate risks on our commercial
transactions, we purchase and enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency options to
cover foreign currency exposure in payables or receivables at our affiliates, which we account for as fair value
instruments. We may in the future purchase or sell similar types of instruments. See “Item 12. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”. Furthermore, we may not predict in a timely fashion the amount
of future transactions in the volatile industry environment. No assurance may be given that our hedging
activities will sufficiently protect us against declines in the value of the U.S. dollar. Consequently, our results of
operations have been and may continue to be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. The net effect of our
consolidated foreign exchange exposure resulted in a net gain of less than $1 million recorded in “Other income
and expenses, net” in our 2019 Consolidated Statement of Income compared to net gains of $4 million and $4
million recorded in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are, for consolidation purposes, translated into U.S. dollars at the
period-end exchange rate. Income and expenses, as well as cash flows, are translated at the average exchange
rate for the period. The balance sheet impact, as well as the income statement and cash flow impact, of such
translations have been, and may be expected to be, significant from period to period since a large part of our
assets and liabilities and activities are accounted for in Euros as they are located in jurisdictions where the Euro
is the functional currency. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded directly in equity, and are
shown as “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in the Consolidated Statements of Equity. At
December 31, 2019, our outstanding indebtedness was denominated mainly in U.S. dollars and in Euros.

For a more detailed discussion, see “Item 3. Key Information — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our
Operations”.

**Impact of Changes in Interest Rates**

Interest rates may fluctuate upon changes in financial market conditions and material changes can affect
our results of operations and financial condition, since these changes can impact the total interest income
received on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as the total interest expense paid on
our financial debt.

Our interest income (expense), net, as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Income, is the balance
between interest income received from our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities investments and
interest expense paid on our financial liabilities (including the sale without recourse of receivables), non-cash
interest expense on the Senior Convertible Bonds and bank fees (including fees on committed credit lines). Our
interest income is dependent upon fluctuations in interest rates, mainly in U.S. dollars and Euros, since we
invest primarily on a short-term basis; any increase or decrease in the market interest rates would mean a
proportional increase or decrease in our interest income. Our interest expenses are also dependent upon
fluctuations in interest rates, since our financial liabilities include European Investment Bank Floating Rate
Loans at Libor and Euribor plus variable spreads.

At December 31, 2019, our total financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities, generated an average interest income rate of 1.83%. At the same date, the average interest rate on our
outstanding debt was 2.21% including the non-cash effective interest of the senior unsecured convertible bonds
issued in 2017, while the average cash interest rate was only 0.24%.

**Impact of Changes in Equity Prices**

As of December 31, 2019, we did not hold any significant equity participations, which could be subject to
a material impact in changes in equity prices. However, on these equity participations, carrying value could be
reduced due to further losses or impairment charges. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Treasury activities are regulated by our policies, which define procedures, objectives and controls. Our
policies focus on the management of our financial risk in terms of exposure to currency rates and interest rates.
Most treasury activities are centralized, with any local treasury activities subject to oversight from our head
treasury office. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held in U.S. dollars and Euros and are placed
with financial institutions rated at least a single A long-term rating, meaning at least A3 from Moody’s Investors
Service (“Moody’s”) and A- from Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) or Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), or better. Marginal
amounts are held in other currencies. See “Item 12. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk”.

Our total liquidity and capital resources were $2,744 million as of December 31, 2019, increasing
compared to $2,596 million at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, our total liquidity and capital
resources were comprised of $2,597 million in cash and cash equivalents, $133 million in marketable securities,
$10 million in restricted cash and $4 million in short-term deposits, all considered as current assets.

As of December 31, 2019, marketable securities were $133 million invested in U.S. Government debt
securities, including Treasury Bonds, with a rating of Aaa/AA+/AAA from Moody’s, S&P and Fitch,
respectively, and a weighted average maturity of 1.5 years. The securities are classified as available-for-sale
and reported at fair value. This fair value measurement corresponds to a Level 1 fair value hierarchy
measurement.

**Liquidity**

We maintain a significant cash position and a low debt-to-equity ratio, which provide us with adequate
financial flexibility. As in the past, our cash management policy is to finance our investment needs mainly with
net cash generated from operating activities.

During 2019, our net cash increased by $341 million, due to net cash from operating activities exceeding
net cash used in investing and financing activities.

The components of our cash flow for the last three years are set forth below:


**Year Ended December 31,**

**2019** **2018** **2017**

**(In millions)**

Net cash from operating activities $ 1,869 $ 1,845 $ 1,677

Net cash used in investing activities (1,172) (1,212) (1,468)

Net cash used in financing activities (343) (122) (106)

Effect of changes in exchange rates (13) (4) 27

**Net cash increase** **$** **341** **$** **507 $** **130**

_Net_ _cash_ _from_ _operating_ _activities. Net cash from operating activities is the sum of (i) net income (loss)_
adjusted for non-cash items and (ii) changes in net working capital. The net cash from operating activities in
2019 was $1,869 million, increasing compared to $1,845 million in the prior year, mainly due to more favorable
changes in net working capital, compensating lower net income.

_Net_ _cash_ _used_ _in_ _investing_ _activities. Investing activities used $1,172 million of cash in 2019, decreasing_
from $1,212 million in the prior year. Payments for purchase of tangible assets, net of proceeds, totaled $1,174
million, compared to $1,262 million registered in the prior-year period. The 2019 numbers also included the
proceeds from matured marketable securities of $200 million and the net cash outflow of $127 million for the
acquisition of Norstel.

_Net_ _cash_ _used_ _in_ _financing_ _activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $343 million for 2019,_
compared to the $122 million used in 2018. The 2019 amount included $281 million proceeds from long-term
debt, $144 million of long-term debt repayment, $250 million of repurchase of common stock and $214 million
of dividends paid to stockholders.

_Free_ _Cash_ _Flow (non-U.S. GAAP_ _measure). We also present Free Cash Flow, which is a non-U.S. GAAP_
measure, defined as (i) net cash from operating activities plus (ii) net cash used in investing activities, excluding
payment for purchases (and proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities, and net cash variation for joint
ventures deconsolidation, which are considered as temporary financial investments. The result of this definition
is ultimately net cash from operating activities plus payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of tangible,
intangible and financial assets, proceeds received in the sale of businesses and cash paid for business
acquisitions. We believe Free Cash Flow, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides useful information for investors
and management because it measures our capacity to generate cash from our operating and investing activities
to sustain our operations. Free Cash Flow is not a U.S. GAAP measure and does not represent total cash flow
since it does not include the cash flows generated by or used in financing activities. Free Cash Flow reconciles
with the total cash flow and the net cash increase (decrease) by including the payment for purchases (and
proceeds from the sale) of marketable securities and net cash variation from joint ventures deconsolidation, the
net cash from (used in) financing activities and the effect of changes in exchange rates. In addition, our
definition of Free Cash Flow may differ from definitions used by other companies. Free Cash Flow is
determined from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as follows:


**Year Ended December 31,**

**2019** **2018** **2017**

**(In millions)**

Net cash from operating activities $ 1,869 $ 1,845 $ 1,677

Net cash used in investing activities (1,172) (1,212) (1,468)

Excluding:

_Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of_
_marketable securities, and net cash variation for_
_joint ventures deconsolidation_ (200) (100) 99

_Payment for purchase and proceeds from sale of_
_tangible and intangible assets, payment for_
_business acquisitions[(1)]_ (1,372) (1,312) (1,369)

**Free Cash Flow (non-U.S. GAAP measure)** **$** **497 $** **533 $** **308**

(1) Reflects the total of the following line items reconciled with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relating to the investing
activities: Payment for purchase of tangible assets, Proceeds from sale of tangible assets, Payment for purchase of intangible assets,
Payment for purchase of financial assets, Proceeds from sale of financial assets, Payment for disposal of equity investment, Proceeds
received in sale of businesses, Payment for business acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired.

Free Cash Flow was positive $497 million in 2019, compared to positive $533 million and positive $308
million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

**Capital Resources**

_Net_ _Financial_ _Position (non-U.S. GAAP_ _measure). Our Net Financial Position represents the difference_
between our total financial resources and our total financial debt. Our total financial resources include cash and
cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and short-term deposits, and our total financial debt
includes short-term debt, including bank overdrafts, and long-term debt, as represented in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Net Financial Position is not a U.S. GAAP measure, but we believe it provides useful
information for investors and management because it gives evidence of our global position either in terms of net
indebtedness or net cash by measuring our capital resources based on cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities and the total level of our financial indebtedness. In addition, our definition of Net Financial Position
may differ from definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Our Net
Financial Position for each period has been determined from our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:


**Year Ended December 31,**

**Net Financial Position** **$** **672 $** **686 $** **489**

Our Net Financial Position as of December 31, 2019 was a net cash position of $672 million, decreasing
compared to the net cash position of $686 million at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2019, our financial debt was $2,072 million, composed of (i) $173 million of current
portion of long-term debt and (ii) $1,899 million of long-term debt. The breakdown of our total financial debt
included: (i) $1,354 million in the senior unsecured convertible bonds issued in 2017, (ii) $706 million in
European Investment Bank loans (the “EIB Loans”), and (iii) $12 million in loans from other funding programs
and other long-term loans. The EIB Loans are comprised of three long-term amortizing credit facilities as part
of our R&D funding programs. The first, signed in 2010, is a €350 million multi-currency loan to support our
industrial and R&D programs. It was drawn mainly in U.S. dollars for an amount of $321 million and only
partially in Euros for an amount of €100 million, of which $55 million remained outstanding as of December 31,
2019. The second, signed in 2013, is a €350 million multi-currency loan which also supports our R&D
programs. It was drawn in U.S. dollars for an amount of $471 million, of which $118 million is outstanding as
of December 31, 2019. The third, signed in August 2017 for a total aggregate amount of €500 million in
relation to R&D and capital expenditure investments in the European Union. It was fully drawn in Euros
corresponding to $533 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

On July 3, 2014, we issued $1,000 million principal amount of dual tranche senior unsecured convertible
bonds (Tranche A for $600 million and Tranche B for $400 million), due 2019 and 2021, respectively. Tranche
A bonds were issued as zero-coupon bonds while Tranche B bonds bore a 1% per annum nominal interest,
payable semi-annually. The conversion price at issuance was approximately $12, equivalent to a 30% and a
31% premium, respectively, on each tranche. On October 3, 2016, the conversion price was adjusted up to
1.24% on each tranche, pursuant to a dividend adjustment symmetric provision, which corresponded to 16,491
and 16,366 equivalent shares per each $200,000 bond par value for Tranche A and Tranche B, respectively. On
October 2, 2017, the conversion price was adjusted up to 1.16% on Tranche B, pursuant to a dividend
adjustment symmetric provision, which corresponded to 16,178 equivalent shares per each $200,000 bond par
value. The bonds were convertible by the bondholders or were callable by the issuer upon certain conditions, an
in each case on a full-cash, full-shares or net-share settlement basis at issuer’s decision. The net proceeds from
the bond offering were approximately $994 million, after deducting issuance costs payable by us. The proceeds
were allocated between debt and equity by first measuring the liability component and then determining the
equity component as a residual amount. The liability component was measured at fair value based on a discount
rate adjustment technique (income approach), which corresponded to a Level 3 fair value hierarchy
measurement. The fair value of the liability component at initial recognition totaled $878 million and was
estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows using a discount rate of 2.40% and 3.22% (including
1% per annum nominal interest), respectively, on each tranche, which was determined to be consistent with the
market rates at the time for similar instruments with no conversion rights. An amount of $121 million, net of
allocated issuance costs of $1 million, was recorded in shareholders’ equity as the value of the conversion
features of the instruments.

In the second quarter of 2017, we issued a redemption notice to inform bondholders of the early
redemption of the Tranche A bonds in July 2017. As a consequence, bondholders exercised their conversion
rights for $598 million nominal value on the total of $600 million of the Tranche A. The remainder amount of
$2 million was early redeemed in cash by us. Each conversion exercised by the bondholders was net-share
settled, upon our election. As a result, we settled $600 million in cash and approximately 13.0 million shares
from treasury shares. We allocated the total consideration transferred between debt and equity by measuring at
fair value the liability component of Tranche A prior to settlement then determining the equity component as a
residual amount. The liability component was measured at fair value based on a discount rate adjustment
technique (income approach), which corresponded to a Level 3 fair value hierarchy measurement and consisted
in calculating the present value of cash flows using an average estimated discount rate of 2.09%, which
corresponds to current market rates for similar bonds that have no conversion rights. The fair value of the
liability component, as measured prior to extinguishment was $574 million for Tranche A bonds, which
generated a loss amounting to $5 million, reported on the line “Loss on financial instruments, net” in the
consolidated statement of income for the period ended December 31, 2017.

Between September 13, 2017 and October 10, 2017, bondholders exercised their conversion rights for
$340 million nominal value on the total of $400 million of the Tranche B bonds. On October 11, 2017, we
issued a redemption notice to inform bondholders of the early redemption of the remaining $60 million nominal
value of the Tranche B on November 10, 2017. As a consequence, bondholders exercised their conversion
rights for $59 million nominal value on the remaining $60 million of the Tranche B. The remainder amount of
$1 million was early redeemed in cash by us. As we elected to net share settle the bonds, each conversion
followed the process defined in the original terms and conditions of the convertible bonds, which determined the
actual number of shares to be transferred upon each conversion. As a result, we settled $400 million in cash and
approximately 13.7 million shares from treasury shares. We allocated the total consideration transferred
between debt and equity by measuring at fair value the liability component of Tranche B prior to settlement then
determining the equity component as a residual amount. The liability component was measured at fair value
based on a discount rate adjustment technique (income approach), which corresponded to a Level 3 fair value
hierarchy measurement and consisted in calculating the present value of cash flows using an average estimated
discount rate of 2.47%, which corresponds to current market rates for similar bonds that have no conversion
rights. The fair value of the liability component, as measured prior to extinguishment was $370 million for
Tranche B bonds, which generated a loss amounting to $11 million, reported on the line “Loss on financial
instruments, net” in the consolidated statement of income for the period ended December 31, 2017.

_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_

We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2019.

**Financial Outlook: Capital Investment**

Our policy is to modulate our capital spending according to the evolution of the semiconductor market.
Based on current market visibility and the combination of new products, customer demand in 2020 and ongoing
strategic initiatives, we plan our capital investment in 2020 at approximately $1.5 billion. A portion of this
capital expenditure will be devoted to support strategic initiatives: (i) in Agrate, Italy the construction of a new
300 mm fab to support next generation mixed signal, IGBT and power technologies; (ii) R&D for GaN power
technologies in Tours 200 mm and production ramp-up for GaN RF devices in Catania 150 mm and (iii)
investments for Silicon Carbide. These include the substrates activities, following the Norstel acquisition. In
addition to our strategic initiatives, our main capital investment in front-end is in (i) our 300 mm fab in Crolles,
optimizing existing infrastructure to support production ramp up on our main runner technologies; (ii) mix
evolution, and a few selected programs of capacity growth and infrastructure preparation. The most important
2020 capital investments for our back-end facilities are expected to be: (i) capacity growth on certain package
families, including the SiC technology, next generation Imaging sensor technologies and new products for
Automotive and Industrial, to sustain market demand; (ii) modernization and rationalization of package lines
targeting cost savings benefits; and (iii) specific investments in the areas of factory automation, quality,
environment and energy savings. In addition, we will invest in overall capacity adjustment in final testing and
wafers probing (EWS) to meet increased demand and a changed product mix as well as invest in quality, safety,
maintenance, productivity and cost savings in both 150 mm, 200 mm front-end fabs and back-end plants.

We will continue to invest to support revenues growth and new products introduction, taking into
consideration factors such as trends in the semiconductor industry and capacity utilization. We expect to need
significant financial resources in the coming years for capital expenditures and for our investments in
manufacturing and R&D. We plan to fund our capital requirements from cash provided by operating activities,
available funds and support from third parties, and may have recourse to borrowings under available credit lines
and, to the extent necessary or attractive based on market conditions prevailing at the time, the issuance of debt,
convertible bonds or additional equity securities. A substantial deterioration of our economic results, and
consequently of our profitability, could generate a deterioration of the cash generated by our operating activities.
Therefore, there can be no assurance that, in future periods, we will generate the same level of cash as in prior
years to fund our capital expenditure plans for expanding/upgrading our production facilities, our working
capital requirements, our R&D and manufacturing costs.

We believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our currently projected business
requirements for the next twelve months, including capital expenditures for our manufacturing activities,
working capital requirements, approved dividend payments and the repayment of our debts in line with their
maturity dates.

Our Audit Committee met ten times during 2019. At many of the Audit Committee’s meetings, the
committee received presentations on current financial and accounting issues and had the opportunity to discuss
with our CEO, CFO, Chief Accountant, Chief Audit and Risk Executive, President, Legal Counsel, Chief
Compliance Officer and external auditors. Our Audit Committee also discussed with outside U.S. legal counsel
corporate requirements pursuant to NYSE’s corporate governance rules and the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Our Audit
Committee also proceeded with its annual review of our internal audit function. Our Audit Committee reviewed
our annual Consolidated Financial Statements in U.S. GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the
results press release was published on January 23, 2020.

Our Audit Committee approved the compensation of our external auditors for 2019 and discussed the
scope of their audit, audit related and non-audit related services for 2019.

At the end of each quarter, prior to each Supervisory Board meeting to approve our quarterly results, our
Audit Committee reviewed our interim financial information and the proposed press release and had the
opportunity to raise questions to management and the independent registered public accounting firm. In
addition, our Audit Committee reviewed our quarterly “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and
Consolidated Financial Statements (and notes thereto) before they were furnished to the SEC and voluntarily
certified by the CEO and the CFO (pursuant to sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act). Our Audit
Committee also reviewed Operating and Financial Review and Prospects and our Consolidated Financial
Statements contained in this Form 20-F, prior to its approval by our Supervisory Board. Furthermore, our Audit
Committee monitored our compliance with the European Directive and applicable provisions of Dutch law that
require us to prepare a set of accounts pursuant to IFRS in advance of our AGM, which was held on May 23,
2019. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Operations”.

Also in 2019, our Audit Committee reviewed with our external auditors our compliance with Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, our Audit Committee regularly reviewed management’s conclusions as
to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, supervised the implementation of our corporate
Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) process, and reviewed our Compliance & Ethics program.

As part of each of its quarterly meetings, our Audit Committee also reviewed our financial results as
presented by Management/ and whistleblowing reports, including independent investigative reports provided by
internal audit or outside consultants on such matters.

_Compensation_ _Committee. Our Compensation Committee advises our Supervisory Board in relation to_
the compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and sole member of our Managing Board,
including the variable portion of such compensation based on performance criteria recommended by our
Compensation Committee. Our Compensation Committee also reviews the stock based compensation plans for
our senior managers and key employees. Our Compensation Committee met twice in 2019.

Among its main activities, in 2019 our Compensation Committee: (i) reviewed the objectives met as
compared to the performance criteria relating to the bonus of our President and CEO, Mr. Jean-Marc Chery, for
the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2018; (ii) defined the performance targets relating to the bonus of our
President and CEO for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2019 (which targets are based on, inter alia,
revenues growth, certain specific financial targets, the share price evolution versus PHLX Semiconductor Sector
Index[SM ] (SOX[SM]) and a list of three special programs); and (iii) established, on behalf and with the approval of
the entire Supervisory Board, the applicable performance criteria, which must be met by senior managers and
selected key employees participating in the employee stock award plans to benefit from such awards. For the
2019 unvested stock awards plan, these performance criteria are based on sales evolution and operating income
evolution, both as compared against a panel of ten semiconductor companies, and the return on net assets
targets.

_Strategic_ _Committee. Our Strategic Committee advises the Supervisory Board on and monitor key_
developments within the semiconductor industry and our overall strategy, and is, in particular, involved in
supervising the execution of corporate strategies and in reviewing long-term planning and budgeting. Our
Strategic Committee met three times in 2019. In addition, there were strategic discussions, many of which
occurred at extended Supervisory Board meetings and involved all Supervisory Board members.

(2) Mr. Dufourcq would have been entitled to receive €167,500 in 2019, but he waived his rights to receive any compensation
from the Company in relation to his mandate as a member of the Supervisory Board.

(3) Since May 23, 2019 Mr. Manzi has not been a member of the Supervisory Board.

Set forth in the following table is the annual change over the last three years of (i) the average

**Average remuneration of all global indirect employees**
**(FTE basis)[(3)]**

Employees $ 97,300 $ 100,600 $ 93,500

(1) Using the euro per US dollar exchange rate on December 31, 2019 of €1 = $1.1213.

(2) Since May 23, 2019 Mr. Manzi has not been a member of the Supervisory Board.

(3) Global indirect employees are all employees other than those directly manufacturing our products.

We do not have any service agreements with members of our Supervisory Board. We did not extend any

or concluded any leases with any of our Supervisory Board members or their families.

_Senior Management Compensation_

Our Senior Management, including the sole member of our Managing Board and our President and Chief
Executive Officer, received a combination of short term and long term compensation. The following table sets
forth the total cash amount paid as compensation in 2019, 2018 and 2017 to the 22, 22 and 20 members,
respectively, of our Senior Management (including the sole member of our Managing Board, our President and
Chief Executive Officer) on duty on December 31[st] of each year, before applicable withholding taxes and social
contributions (amounts in millions):


**2019[(1)]** **2018[(3)]** **2017[(3)]**

**Total cash amount paid as compensation[(2)]** **$** **21.3** **$** **22.2** **$** **19.0**

(1) Including amounts paid in 2019 to our former President, Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility, Mr. Brun.

(2) Total cash amount paid as compensation comprises fixed salary, annual cash bonus incentive and other cash benefits. In
addition, non-cash amounts paid as compensation, including vested stock awards and other non-cash benefits, as well as all
applicable withholding taxes, pension contributions and social contributions, were approximately $22.3 million in 2019, $25.3
million in 2018 and $12.5 million in 2017. Total cash amount paid as compensation includes the fixed salary, annual cash
bonus incentive and other cash benefits paid to our former President, Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility,
Mr. Brun.

(3) In 2019, we changed the classification of pension contributions and we determined that pension contributions are attributable to
non-cash amounts paid as compensation. In addition, in 2019, we classified housing and meal allowances (as applicable) as
other cash benefits. The reclassification of pension contributions and housing and meal allowances resulted in restatement of
the total cash amount paid as compensation and non-cash amounts paid as compensation in 2018 and 2017.

The annual cash bonus incentive, which we call Corporate Executive Incentive Program (the “EIP”),
entitles selected executives to a yearly bonus based upon the assessment of the achievement of individual,
organizational and company objectives that are set on an annual basis and focused, inter _alia, on return on net_
assets, customer service, profit, cash flow and market share. The maximum bonus awarded under the EIP is
based upon a percentage of the executive’s salary and the overall achievement of the above objectives on an
annual basis.

(i) CEO Bonus

In accordance with the resolutions adopted at our AGM held on May 30, 2012, the annual bonus of the
sole member of our Managing Board and President and Chief Executive Officer is composed of a portion
payable in cash (up to a maximum of 150% of the base salary for the relevant year) and a portion payable in
shares (up to a maximum of 60% of the base salary for the relevant year), all subject to the assessment and
fulfillment of a number of pre-defined conditions which are set annually by the Compensation Committee of our
Supervisory Board.

Consistent with the remuneration policy adopted by our General Meeting of Shareholders, the Supervisory
Board, upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, set the conditions and performance criteria
that must be met by Mr. Chery for the attribution of his 2019 bonus. Those conditions are based, inter _alia, on_
revenues growth, certain financial targets, the share price evolution versus the SOX[SM], as well as certain special
programs. The evaluation and assessment of the fulfillment of those conditions and performance criteria, will
be done by the Compensation Committee of our Supervisory Board within the first months of the following year
(i.e. in 2020 for the 2019 CEO bonus), in order to determine the actual amount of the CEO bonus for 2019.

(ii) CEO Stock Awards

The Supervisory Board, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, determines whether the
performance criteria, as described below, have been met and conclude whether and to which extent all eligible
employees, including the sole member of our Managing Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, are
entitled to any stock awards under the stock award plan. The stock awards vest 32% after one year, a further
32% after two years and the remaining 36% after three years, respectively, after the date of the grant as defined
by the plan, provided that the eligible employee is still an employee at such time (subject to the acceleration
provisions in the event of a change in control).

of our Supervisory Board in March/April, 2020 in order to determine the actual number of stock awards to be allocated for 2019.

(2) In accordance with the resolution adopted by our General Meeting of Shareholders, the maximum grant allowed in relation to the
CEO stock award for each of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 was 100,000 unvested stocks awards.

**Common Shares Owned**

**Shareholders** **Number**

STMicroelectronics Holding N.V. (“ST Holding”) 250,704,754

Public 640,729,735

Treasury shares 19,752,431

**Total** **911,186,920**


We are not aware of any significant change over the past three years in the percentage ownership of our
shares by ST Holding, our major shareholder. ST Holding does not have any different voting rights from those
of our other shareholders.

_Shareholders Agreement_

According to the report on Schedule 13G (“ST Holding 13G”) jointly filed with the SEC on February 11,
2020 by ST Holding, the Italian Ministry of the Economy and Finance (the “MEF”), Bpifrance Participations
S.A., a successor to its former wholly-owned subsidiary FT1CI, (“Bpifrance” and together with the MEF, the
“STH Shareholders”) and the Italian Government and the French Government, each indirectly through the MEF
and Bpifrance, respectively, hold 14.1% of our share capital as of December 31, 2019. The ownership
percentages of each the MEF and Bpifrance are based on 891,434,489 shares outstanding as of December 31,
2019. On November 17, 2016, Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (“CEA”) and
Bpifrance, which were, at the time, the shareholders of FT1CI, entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant
to which CEA transferred 721,513 shares of FT1CI to Bpifrance. As a result of the transaction, Bpifrance
increased its shareholding in FT1CI from 79.2% to 95.1%, with CEA retaining the remaining 4.9% in FT1CI.
On November 16, 2018, CEA and Bpifrance entered into a second purchase agreement, pursuant to which CEA
transferred 222,265 shares, representing its remaining ownership interest in FT1CI, to Bpifrance. As a result of
this transaction, Bpifrance became the sole shareholder of FT1CI. On June 21, 2019, FT1CI merged with and
into Bpifrance and ceased to exist. The filers of the ST Holding 13G have entered into a shareholders
agreement which governs relations between them, including for certain matters relating to the ownership of our
shares and the actions of our management to the extent shareholder approval is required (the “STH Shareholders
Agreement”). Below is a brief summary of certain details from the ST Holding 13G.

_Corporate Governance_

Managing Board and Supervisory Board members can only be appointed by the General Meeting of
Shareholders upon a proposal by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board passes resolutions, including
on such a proposal, by at least three quarters of the votes of the members in office. The STH Shareholders
Agreement, to which STM is not a party, furthermore provides that: (i) each of the STH Shareholders,
Bpifrance, on the one hand, and the MEF, on the other hand, may propose the same number of members for
election to the Supervisory Board by our shareholders, and ST Holding shall vote in favor of such members; and
(ii) any decision relating to the voting rights of ST Holding shall require the unanimous approval of the STH
Shareholders. ST Holding may therefore be in a position to effectively control actions that require shareholder
approval, including, as discussed above, the proposal of six out of nine members for election to our Supervisory
Board (three members by each STH Shareholder) and the appointment of our Managing Board, as well as
corporate actions, and the issuance of new shares or other securities. As a result of the STH Shareholders
Agreement, the Chairman of our Supervisory Board is proposed by an STH Shareholder for a three-year term,
and the Vice-Chairman of our Supervisory Board is proposed by the other STH Shareholder for the same period,
and vice-versa for the following three-year term. The STH Shareholder proposing the appointment of the
Chairman may furthermore propose the appointment of the Assistant Secretary of our Supervisory Board, and
the STH Shareholder proposing the appointment of Vice-Chairman proposes the appointment of the Secretary of
our Supervisory Board. Finally, each STH Shareholder also proposes the appointment of a Financial Controller
to the Supervisory Board.

_Ownership of ST Shares_

The STH Shareholders Agreement provides that each STH Shareholder retains the right to cause ST
Holding to dispose of its stake in us at its sole discretion pursuant to the issuance of financial instruments, an
equity swap, a structured finance deal or a straight sale; however, except in the case of a public offer, no sales
by any party to the STH Shareholders Agreement may be made of any of our shares or any shares of Bpifrance
or ST Holding to any of our top ten competitors or any company controlling such a competitor. The STH
Shareholders Agreement also requires all of the parties to the STH Shareholders Agreement to hold their stakes
in us at all time through the current holding structure of ST Holding, subject to certain limited exceptions, and
precludes all such parties and their affiliates from acquiring any of our common shares other than through ST
Holding.

_Change of Control Provision_

The STH Shareholders Agreement provides for tag-along rights, pre-emptive rights, and provisions with
respect to a change of control of any of the STH Shareholders or any controlling shareholder of Bpifrance, on
the one hand, and the Italian Ministry of the Economy and Finance, on the other hand. The STH Shareholders
may transfer shares of ST Holding and/or Bpifrance, as applicable, to any of their respective affiliates, which
could include entities ultimately controlled by the Italian Government or the French Government.

_Preference Shares_

We have an option agreement with an independent foundation, Stichting Continuiteït ST (the “Stichting”),
whereby the Stichting can acquire a maximum of 540,000,000 preference shares in the event of actions which
the board of the Stichting determines would be contrary to our interests, our shareholders and our other
stakeholders and which in the event of a creeping acquisition or an unsolicited offer for our common shares are
not supported by our Managing Board and Supervisory Board. If the Stichting exercises its call option and
acquires preference shares, it must pay at least 25% of the par value of such preference shares. The preference
shares may remain outstanding for no longer than two years.

No preference shares have been issued to date. The effect of the preference shares may be to deter
potential acquirers from effecting an unsolicited acquisition resulting in a change of control as well as to create a
level-playing field in the event actions which are considered hostile by our Managing Board and Supervisory
Board, as described above, occur and which the board of the Stichting determines to be contrary to our interests
and our shareholders and other stakeholders. In addition, any issuance of additional capital within the limits of
our authorized share capital, as approved by our shareholders, is subject to approval by our Supervisory Board,
other than pursuant to an exercise of the call option granted to the Stichting.

**Related Party Transactions**

with significant shareholders, their affiliates and other related parties, which also include transactions between
us and our equity method investments.

**Dividend Policy**

Our dividend policy reads as follows: “STMicroelectronics seeks to use its available cash in order to
develop and enhance its position in a competitive semiconductor market while at the same time managing its
cash resources to reward its shareholders for their investment and trust in STMicroelectronics. Based on its
results, projected capital requirements as well as business conditions and prospects, the Managing Board
proposes on an annual basis to the Supervisory Board, whenever deemed possible and desirable in line with
STMicroelectronics’ objectives and financial situation, the distribution of a quarterly cash dividend, if any. The
Supervisory Board, upon the proposal of the Managing Board, decides or proposes on an annual basis, in
accordance with this policy, which portion of the profits or distributable reserves shall not be retained in
reserves to fund future growth or for other purposes and makes a proposal concerning the amount, if any, of the
quarterly cash dividend”.

On May 23, 2019, our shareholders approved a cash dividend of US$0.24 per outstanding share of our
common stock, which was distributed in quarterly installments of US$0.06 in each of the second, third and
fourth quarters of 2019 and will also be distributed in the first quarter of 2020. Future dividends, if any, and
their timing and amounts may be affected by our accumulated profits, our capacity to generate cash flow, our
financial situation, the general economic situation and prospects and any other factors that the Supervisory
Board, upon the recommendation of our Managing Board, shall deem important. For a history of dividends paid
by us to our shareholders in the past three years, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
“Shareholders’ Equity – Dividends”.

**Item 9.** **Listing**

**Market Information**

Our common shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “STM” and CUSIP #861012102, are listed
on the compartment A (large capitalizations) of Euronext Paris under the ISIN Code NL0000226223 and are
traded on the Borsa Italiana. In 2017, ST issued a $1.5 billion dual-tranche offering of new Convertible Bonds
due 2022 and 2024 that trade on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

Effective September 18, 2017 our common shares were re-admitted by the independent Conseil
Scientifique to the CAC 40, a free float market capitalization weighted index that reflects the performance of the
40 most capitalized and traded shares listed on Euronext Paris, and is the most widely used indicator of the Paris
stock market. Our common shares are included in the FTSE MIB Index, which measures the performance of the
40 most liquid and capitalized shares listed on the Borsa Italiana and seeks to replicate the broad sector weights
of the Italian stock market, and the FTSE MIB Dividend Index, the index which represents the cumulative value
of ordinary gross dividends paid by the individual constituents of the underlying FTSE MIB Index, expressed in
terms of index points.

Of the 891,434,489 common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019, 62,416,409, or 7.0%, were
registered in the common share registry maintained on our behalf in New York and 829,018,080 or 93.0%, of
our common shares outstanding were listed on Euroclear France and traded on Euronext Paris and on the Borsa
Italiana in Milan.

**Item 10.** **Additional Information**

**A.** **Share Capital**

Not applicable.

**B.** **Memorandum and Articles of Association**

We were incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands by deed of May 21, 1987 and are registered with
the trade register (handelsregister) of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (Kamer _van_ _Koophandel) under no._
33194537. Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of our Articles of Association and relevant Dutch
law. The summary below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our
Articles of Association, most recently amended on June 20, 2017, and relevant Dutch law.

87


-----

Table of Contents

_Object and Purposes (Article 2)_

The purpose of our company is to participate in or take, in any manner, any interests in other business
enterprises; to manage such enterprises; to carry on business in semiconductors and electronic devices; to take
and grant licenses and other industrial property interests; to assume commitments in the name of any enterprises
with which we may be associated within a group of companies; and to take any other action, such as but not
limited to the granting of securities or the undertaking of obligations on behalf of third parties, which in the
broadest sense of the term, may be related or contribute to the aforementioned objects.

_Supervisory Board Members_

Our Articles of Association do not include any provisions related to a Supervisory Board member’s:

-  power to vote on proposals, arrangements or contracts in which such member is materially
interested;

-  power, in the absence of an independent quorum, to vote on compensation to themselves or any
members of the Supervisory Board;

-  borrowing powers exercisable by the directors and how such borrowing powers can be varied;

-  mandatory retirement age; or

-  number of owned shares in our company required to qualify as a Supervisory Board member.

Our Supervisory Board Charter and Dutch law, however, explicitly prohibits members of our Supervisory
Board from participating in discussions and voting on matters where they have a conflict of interest. If our
entire Supervisory Board has a conflict of interest, our shareholders’ meeting is the competent corporate body to
adopt the relevant resolution. Our Articles of Association provide that our shareholders’ meeting must adopt the
compensation of our Supervisory Board members. Neither our Articles of Association nor our Supervisory
Board Charter has a requirement or policy that Supervisory Board members hold a minimum number of our
common shares.

We have balanced participation by men and women on our Supervisory Board and currently, our
Supervisory Board comprises nine members of which 4 are female and 5 are male.

_Distribution of Profits (Articles 37, 38, 39 and 40)_

Subject to certain exceptions, dividends may only be paid out of the profits as shown in our adopted
annual accounts. Our profits must first be used to set up and maintain reserves required by Dutch law and our
Articles of Association. Subsequently, if any of our preference shares are issued and outstanding, preference
shareholders shall be paid a dividend, which will be a percentage of the paid up part of the par value of their
preference shares. Our Supervisory Board may then, upon proposal of our Managing Board, also establish
reserves out of our annual profits. The portion of our annual profits that remains after the establishment or
maintenance of reserves and the payment of a dividend to our preference shareholders is at the disposal of our
shareholders’ meeting. No distribution may be made to our shareholders when the equity after such distribution
is or becomes inferior to the fully-paid share capital, increased by the legal reserves. Our preference shares are
cumulative by nature, which means that if in a financial year the dividend or the preference shares cannot be
(fully) paid, the deficit must first be paid in the following financial year(s).

Our Supervisory Board independently as well as our shareholders’ meeting, upon the proposal of our
Supervisory Board, may each declare distributions out of our share premium reserve and other reserves
available for shareholder distributions under Dutch law. Pursuant to a resolution of our Supervisory Board,
distributions adopted by the shareholders’ meeting may be fully or partially made in the form of our new shares
to be issued. Our Supervisory Board may, subject to certain statutory provisions, make one or more interim
distributions in respect of any year before the accounts for such year have been adopted at a shareholders’
meeting. Rights to cash dividends and distributions that have not been collected within five years after the date
on which they became due and payable shall revert to us.

For the history of dividends paid by us to our shareholders in the past five years, see Note 17 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Notice Convening the Shareholders’ Meeting (Articles 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29)_

Our ordinary shareholders’ meetings are held at least annually, within six months after the close of each
financial year, in The Netherlands. Extraordinary shareholders’ meetings may be held as often as our
Supervisory Board deems necessary, and must be held upon the written request of registered shareholders or
other persons entitled to attend shareholders’ meetings of at least 10% of the total issued share capital to our
Managing Board or our Supervisory Board specifying in detail the business to be dealt with. Such written
requests may not be submitted electronically.

The notice convening the shareholders’ meeting shall be given in such manner as shall be authorized or
required by law with due observance of the statutory notice period, which is currently 42 days prior to the
meeting.

One or more shareholders or other persons entitled to attend shareholders’ meetings representing at least
one-tenth of our issued share capital may, provided that the request was made at least five days prior to the date
of convocation of the meeting, request proposals to be included on the agenda. Furthermore, a request that a
proposal be included on the agenda can be made in writing to our Managing Board within sixty days of a
meeting by persons who are entitled to attend our shareholders’ meetings who, solely or jointly, represent at
least 1% of our issued share capital or a market value of at least €50 million. The aforementioned requests may
not be submitted electronically and must comply with conditions stipulated by our Managing Board, subject to
the approval of our Supervisory Board, which shall be posted on our website. Pursuant to Dutch law a
shareholder requesting discussion of an agenda item must disclose to us its entire beneficial interest (long and
short position) and we are required to disclose this information on our website.

We are exempt from the proxy solicitation rules under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Euroclear France will provide notice of shareholders’ meetings to, and compile voting instructions from, holders
of shares held directly or indirectly through Euroclear France. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will
provide notice of shareholders’ meetings to holders of shares held directly or indirectly through DTC and the
New York Transfer Agent and Registrar will compile voting instructions. In order for holders of shares held
directly or indirectly through Euroclear France to attend shareholders’ meetings in person, such holders must
withdraw their shares from Euroclear France and have such shares registered directly in their name or in the
name of their nominee. In order for holders of shares held directly or indirectly through DTC to attend
shareholders’ meetings of shareholders in person, such holders need not withdraw such shares from DTC but
must follow rules and procedures established by the New York Transfer Agent and Registrar.

_Attendance at Shareholders’ Meetings and Voting Rights (Articles 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34)_

Each share is entitled to one vote.

All shareholders and other persons entitled to attend shareholders’ meetings may attend in person or be
represented by a person holding a written proxy. Shareholders and other persons entitled to vote, may do so
pursuant to our Articles of Association. Subject to the approval of our Supervisory Board, our Managing Board
may resolve to facilitate the use of electronic means of communication in relation to the participation and voting
in shareholders’ meetings. Dutch law prescribes a fixed registration date of 28 days prior to the shareholders’
meeting, which means that shareholders and other persons entitled to attend shareholders’ meetings are those
persons who have such rights at the 28th day prior to the shareholders’ meeting and, as such, are registered in a
register designated by our Managing Board, regardless of who is a shareholder or otherwise a person entitled to
attend shareholders’ meetings at the time of the meeting if a registration date would not be applicable. In the
notice convening the shareholders’ meeting, the time of registration must be mentioned as well as the manner in
which shareholders and other persons entitled to attend shareholders’ meetings can register themselves and the
manner in which they can exercise their rights.

All matters regarding admittance to the shareholders’ meeting, the exercise of voting rights and the result
of voting, as well as any other matters regarding the business of the shareholders’ meeting, shall be decided
upon by the chairman of that meeting, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2:13 of the Dutch Civil
Code.

89


-----

Table of Contents

Our Articles of Association allow for separate meetings for holders of common shares and for holders of
preference shares. At a meeting of holders of preference shares at which the entire issued capital of shares of
such class is represented, valid resolutions may be adopted even if the requirements in respect of the place of the
meeting and the giving of notice have not been observed, provided that such resolutions are adopted by
unanimous vote. Also, valid resolutions of preference shareholder meetings may be adopted outside a meeting
if all persons entitled to vote on our preference shares indicate in writing that they vote in favor of the proposed
resolution, provided that no depositary receipts for preference shares have been issued with our cooperation.

_Authority of our Shareholders’ Meeting (Articles 12, 16, 19, 25, 28, 32 and 41)_

Our AGM may decide upon (i) the discharge of the members of our Managing Board for their
management during the past financial year and the discharge of the members of our Supervisory Board for their
supervision during the past financial year; (ii) the adoption of our statutory annual accounts and the distribution
of dividends; (iii) the appointment of the members of our Supervisory Board and our Managing Board; and (iv)
any other resolutions listed on the agenda.

Furthermore, our shareholders’ meeting has to approve resolutions of our Managing Board regarding a
significant change in the identity or nature of us or our enterprise, including in any event (i) transferring our
enterprise or practically our entire enterprise to a third party, (ii) entering into or canceling any long-term
cooperation between us or a subsidiary of us and any other legal person or company or as a fully liable general
partner of a limited partnership or a general partnership, provided that such cooperation or the cancellation
thereof is of essential importance to us, and (iii) us or a subsidiary of us acquiring or disposing of a participating
interest in the capital of a company with a value of at least one-third of our total assets according to our
Consolidated Balance Sheets and notes thereto in our most recently adopted annual accounts.

Our Articles of Association may only be amended (and our liquidation can only be decided on) if
amendments are proposed by our Supervisory Board and approved by a simple majority of the votes cast at a
shareholders’ meeting at which at least 15% of the issued and outstanding share capital is present or represented.
The complete proposal for the amendment (or liquidation) must be made available for inspection by the
shareholders and the other persons entitled to attend shareholders’ meetings at our offices as from the day of the
notice convening such meeting until the end of the meeting. Any amendment of our Articles of Association that
negatively affects the rights of the holders of a certain class of shares requires the prior approval of the meeting
of holders of such class of shares.

_Quorum and Majority (Articles 4, 13 and 32)_

Unless otherwise required by our Articles of Association or Dutch law, resolutions of shareholders’
meetings require the approval of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which at least 15% of the issued and
outstanding share capital is present or represented, subject to the provisions explained below. We may not vote
our common shares held in treasury. Blank and invalid votes shall not be counted.

A quorum of shareholders, present or represented, holding at least half of our issued share capital, is
required to dismiss a member of our Managing Board, unless the dismissal is proposed by our Supervisory
Board. In the event of the lack of a quorum, a second shareholders’ meeting must be held within four weeks,
with no applicable quorum requirement. Any decision or authorization by the shareholders’ meeting which has
or could have the effect of excluding or limiting preferential subscription rights must be taken by a majority of
at least two-thirds of the votes cast, if at the shareholders’ meeting less than 50% of the issued and outstanding
share capital is present or represented. Otherwise such a resolution can be taken by a simple majority at a
meeting at which at least 15% of the issued and outstanding share capital is represented.

_Disclosure of holdings and capital interest under Dutch Law_

Holders of our shares (including certain comparable instruments, such as instruments with a value (partly)
dependent on shares or distributions on shares, or contracts creating an economic position similar to shares) or
voting rights (including potential interests, such as via options or convertible bonds) may have disclosure
obligations under Dutch law. Any person or entity whose direct or indirect interest in our share capital or voting
rights (including potential interest) reaches, exceeds or falls below a certain threshold must make a disclosure to
the AFM immediately. The threshold percentages are 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%,
75% and 95%. If a person’s direct or indirect interest in the share capital or voting rights passively reaches,
exceeds or falls below the abovementioned thresholds (e.g. as a result of a change in the capital of the
company), the person in question must give notice to the AFM no later than the fourth trading day after the
AFM has published the change in the share capital and/or voting rights in the public register. In addition, a
notification requirement applies in respect of shares with special statutory rights (e.g. priority shares), regardless
of the abovementioned percentages.

90


-----

Table of Contents

Furthermore, each person who is or ought to be aware that the substantial holding he holds in the
Company, reaches, exceeds or falls below any of the abovementioned thresholds vis-à-vis his most recent
notification to the AFM, which change relates to the composition of the notification as a result of certain acts
(e.g. (i) the exchange of certain financial instruments for shares or depositary receipts for shares, (ii) the
exchange of shares for depositary receipts for shares, or (iii) as a result of the exercise of rights pursuant to a
contract for the acquisition of voting rights) must give notice to the AFM no later than the fourth trading day
after he became or ought to be aware of this change.

For the purpose of calculating the percentage of capital interest or voting rights, among others, the
following interests must be taken into account: (i) those directly held by him; (ii) those held by his controlled
undertakings for purposes of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act; (iii) shares held by a third party for such
person’s account and the votes such third party may exercise; (iv) the votes held by a third party if such person
has concluded an oral or written voting agreement with such party which provides for a lasting common policy
on voting; (v) the votes held by a third party if such person has concluded an oral or written agreement with
such party which provides for a temporary and paid transfer of the votes; and (vi) the votes which a person may
exercise as a proxy but in his own discretion. A person who has a 3% or larger interest in the share capital or
voting rights and who ceases to be a controlled undertaking must without delay notify the AFM. As of that
moment, all notification obligations under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act will become applicable to the
former controlled undertaking itself. The management company of a common fund (beleggingsfonds) shall be
deemed to have the disposal of the shares held by the depositary and the related voting rights. The depositary of
a common fund shall be deemed not to have the disposal of shares or voting rights. Furthermore, special rules
apply to the attribution of the ordinary shares which are part of the property of a partnership or other community
of property. A holder of a pledge or right of usufruct in respect of our shares can also be subject to a
notification obligation if such person has, or can acquire, the right to vote on our shares. If a pledgor or
usufructuary acquires such voting rights, this may also trigger a notification obligation for the holder of our
shares. A person is also deemed to hold shares if he has a financial instrument (i) whose rise in value depends in
part on the rise in value of the underlying shares or on dividend or other payments on those shares (in other
words, a long position must be held in those shares), and (ii) which does not entitle him to acquire shares in a
listed company (i.e., it is a cash-settled financial instrument). In addition, a person who may, by virtue of an
option, be obliged to buy shares in a listed company is also equated with a shareholder. Moreover, a person who
has entered into a contract (other than a cash-settled financial instrument) that gives him an economic position
comparable to that of a shareholder in a listed company is also deemed to hold shares for the purposes of the
disclosure obligation.

The holder of a financial instrument representing a short position in our shares is required to notify the
AFM if such short position, expressed in a capital percentage, reaches or crosses a threshold percentage. The
threshold percentages are the same as referred to above in this section. Short position refers to the gross short
position (i.e., a long position held by the holder cannot be offset against the short position). There is also a
requirement to notify the AFM of the net short position (i.e., long positions are offset against short positions) if
such short position, expressed in a capital percentage, reaches or crosses a threshold percentage; The threshold
percentages are 0.2% and each 0.1% above that. Notifications as of 0.5% and each 0.1% above that will be
published by the AFM. The notification shall be made no later than 3:30 pm CET on the following trading day.

Under Dutch law, the sole member of our Managing Board and each of the members of our Supervisory
Board must without delay notify the AFM of any changes in his interest or potential interest in our share capital
or voting rights. Under the European Market Abuse Regulation, the sole member of our Managing Board, the
members of the Executive Committee and each of the members of our Supervisory Board, as well as any other
person who would have the power to take managerial decisions affecting the future developments and business
prospects of the Company having regular access to inside information relating, directly or indirectly, to the
Company, must notify the AFM of any transactions conducted for his or her own account relating to the shares
or in financial instruments the value of which is also based on the value of the shares. In addition, certain
persons who are closely associated with members of the Managing Board, the Executive Committee and
Supervisory Board or any of the other persons as described above, are required to notify the AFM of any
transactions conducted for their own account relating to the shares or in financial instruments the value of which
is also based on the value of the shares.

The AFM publishes all notifications on its public website (www.afm.nl). Non-compliance with the
notification obligations under European or Dutch law can lead to imprisonment or criminal fines, or
administrative fines or other administrative sanctions. In addition, non-compliance with these notification
obligations may lead to civil sanctions, including, without limitation, suspension of the voting rights attaching to
our shares held by the offender for a maximum of three years, (suspension and) nullification of a resolution
adopted by our shareholders’ meeting (if it is likely that such resolution would not have been adopted if the
offender had not voted) and a prohibition for the offender to acquire our shares or votes for a period of no more
than five years. Shareholders are advised to consult with their own legal advisers to determine whether
notification obligations apply to them.

_Share Capital (Articles 4, 5 and 6)_

Our shares may not be issued at less than their par value. Our common shares must be fully paid up at the
time of their issuance. Our preference shares must be paid up for at least 25% of their par value at the time of
their issuance (and the remaining 75% if and when requested by our Managing Board). Our authorized share
capital is not restricted by redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions or liability to further capital calls by
us. Our Articles of Association allows for the acquisition of own shares and the cancellation of shares.

Type II shares are common shares in the form of an entry in our shareholders register with the issue of a
share certificate consisting of a main part without a dividend coupon. In addition to type II shares, type I shares
are available. Type I shares are common shares in the form of an entry in our shareholders register without the
issue of a share certificate. Type II shares are only available should our Supervisory Board decide to offer them.
Our preference shares are in the form of an entry in our shareholders register without issue of a share certificate.

Non-issued authorized share capital, which is different from issued share capital, allows us to proceed
with capital increases excluding the preemptive rights, upon our Supervisory Board’s decision. Other securities
in circulation which give access to our share capital include (i) the options giving the right to subscribe to our
shares granted to our employees, including the sole member of our Managing Board and our senior managers;
(ii) the options giving the right to subscribe to our shares granted in the past to the members of our Supervisory
Board, its secretaries and controllers, as described in “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees”;
(iii) our Bonds; and (iv) the option giving the right to subscribe to our preference shares to Stichting Continuïteit
ST. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions — Preference Shares”. We do not have
securities not representing our share capital.

Our shareholders’ meeting, upon proposal and on the terms and conditions set by our Supervisory Board,
has the power to issue shares and rights to subscribe for shares. The shareholders’ meeting may authorize our
Supervisory Board, for a period of no more than five years, to issue shares and rights to subscribe for shares and
to determine the terms and conditions of such issuances.

Each holder of common shares has a pro rata preemptive right to subscribe to an offering of common
shares issued for cash in proportion to the number of common shares which he owns. There is no preemptive
right with respect to an offering of shares for non-cash consideration, with respect to an offering of shares to our
employees or to the employees of one of our subsidiaries, or with respect to preference shares.

Our shareholders’ meeting, upon proposal by our Supervisory Board, has the power to limit or exclude
preemptive rights in connection with new issuances of shares. Such a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting
must be taken with a majority of at least two-thirds of the votes cast if at such shareholders’ meeting less than
50% of the issued and outstanding share capital is present or represented. Otherwise such a resolution can be
taken by a simple majority of the votes cast at a shareholders’ meeting at which at least 15% of our issued and
outstanding share capital is present or represented. Our shareholders’ meeting may authorize our Supervisory
Board, for a period of no more than five years, to limit or exclude preemptive rights.

_Acquisition of Shares in Our Own Share Capital (Article 5)_

We may acquire our own shares, subject to certain provisions of Dutch law and of our Articles of
Association. Share acquisitions may be effected by our Managing Board, subject to the approval of our
Supervisory Board, only if the shareholders’ meeting has authorized our Managing Board to effect such
repurchases, which authorization may apply for a maximum period of 18 months. We may not vote shares we
hold in treasury. Our purchases of our own shares are subject to acquisition price conditions as authorized by
our shareholders’ meeting. Our Articles of Association provide that we shall be able to acquire shares in our
own share capital in order to transfer these shares under employee stock option or stock purchase plans, without
an authorization of our shareholders’ meeting.

92

Table of Contents

Upon the proposal of our Supervisory Board, our shareholders’ meeting may, in accordance with the legal
provisions, reduce our issued capital by canceling the shares that we hold in treasury, by reducing the par value
of the shares or by canceling our preference shares.

_Liquidation Rights (Articles 42 and 43)_

In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, after payment of all debts and liquidation expenses, the
holders of preference shares if issued, would receive the paid up portion of the par value of their preference
shares. Any assets then remaining shall be distributed among the registered holders of common shares in
proportion to the par value of their shareholdings.

_Limitations on Right to Hold or Vote Shares_

There are currently no limitations imposed by Dutch law or by our Articles of Association on the right of
non-resident holders to hold or vote the shares.

**C.** **Material Contracts**

None.

**D.** **Exchange Controls**

**E.** **Taxation**

**Dutch Taxation**

_The following is a general summary and the tax consequences as described herein may not apply to a_
_holder of common shares. Any potential investor should consult his tax adviser for more information about the_
_tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of common shares in his particular circumstances._

This summary solely addresses the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
disposal of common shares and does not purport to describe every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a
particular holder of common shares. In view of its general nature, this general summary should be treated with
corresponding caution.

Tax matters are complex, and the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposal to a
particular holder of common shares will depend in part on such holder’s circumstances. Accordingly, you are
urged to consult your own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposal to you, including the applicability and effect of Dutch tax laws.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to
be attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch
concepts under Dutch tax law. Where in this summary the terms “The Netherlands” and “Dutch” are used, these
refer solely to the European part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands.

This summary assumes that we are organized, and that our business will be conducted, in the manner
outlined in this Form 20-F. A change to such organizational structure or to the manner in which we conduct our
business may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect any such change.

This summary is based on the tax law of The Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands
at the date of this Form 20-F. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is subject to changes, possibly
with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be
updated to reflect such change.

The summary in this Dutch Taxation paragraph does not address your Dutch tax consequences if you are a
holder of common shares who:

(i) may be deemed an owner of common shares for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to specific statutory
attribution rules in Dutch tax law;

(ii) is, although in principle subject to Dutch corporation tax, in whole or in part, specifically exempt
from that tax in connection with income from common shares;

93

Table of Contents

(iii) is an investment institution as defined in the Dutch Corporation Tax Act 1969;

(iv) owns common shares in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory
board, an employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role; or

(v) has a substantial interest in us or a deemed substantial interest in us for Dutch tax purposes.
Generally, you hold a substantial interest in us if (a) you — either alone or, in the case of an
individual, together with your partner or any of your relatives by blood or by marriage in the direct
line (including foster-children) or of those of your partner for Dutch tax purposes — own or are
deemed to own, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of our shares or of any class of our
shares, or rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such an interest in our shares or profit participating
certificates relating to five percent or more of our annual profits or to five percent or more of our
liquidation proceeds, or (b) your shares, rights to acquire shares or profit participating certificates in
us are held by you following the application of a non-recognition provision.

**Taxes on income and capital gains**

_Dutch Resident Entities_

Generally speaking, if you are an entity that is a resident or deemed to be a resident of The Netherlands
for Dutch corporation tax purposes (a 'Dutch Resident Entity'), any payment under the common shares or any
gain or loss realized on the disposal or deemed disposal of the common shares is subject to Dutch corporation
tax at a rate of 16.5% with respect to taxable profits up to €200,000 and 25% with respect to taxable profits in
excess of that amount (rates and brackets for 2020).

_Dutch Resident Individuals_

If you are an individual resident or deemed to be resident of The Netherlands for Dutch income tax
purposes (a 'Dutch Resident Individual'), any payment under the common shares or any gain or loss realized on
the disposal or deemed disposal of the common shares is taxable at the progressive Dutch income tax rates (with
a maximum of 49.50% in 2020), if:

(i) the common shares are attributable to an enterprise from which you derive a share of the profit,
whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value
(medegerechtigd tot het vermogen) of such enterprise other than as a shareholder (as defined in the
Dutch Income Tax Act 2001); or

(ii) you are considered to perform activities with respect to the common shares that go beyond ordinary
asset management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) or you derive benefits from the common
shares that are taxable as benefits from other activities (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden).

If the above-mentioned conditions (i) and (ii) do not apply to you, you will be taxed annually on a deemed
return (with a maximum of 5.33% in 2020) on your net investment assets (rendementsgrondslag) for the year,
insofar your net in-vestment assets for the year exceed a statutory threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The deemed
return on your net investment assets for the year is taxed at a rate of 30%. Actual income, gains or losses in
respect of the common shares are as such not subject to Dutch income tax.

The net investment assets for the year are the fair market value of the investment assets less the allowable
liabilities on January 1 of the relevant calendar year. The common shares are included as investment assets. For
the net investment assets on January 1, 2020, the deemed return ranges from 1.7991% up to 5.33% (depending
on the aggregate amount of the net investment assets of the individual on January 1, 2020). The deemed return
will be adjusted annually on the basis of historic market yields.

Table of Contents

_Non-resident Individuals_

If you are not a Dutch Resident Individual, you will not be subject to Dutch income tax in respect of any
benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with your common shares, except if:

(i) you derive a share of the profit from an enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a coentitlement to the net value of such enterprise, other than as a shareholder, and such enterprise is
carried on, in whole or in part, through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in
The Netherlands, and your common shares are attributable to such permanent establishment or
permanent representative; or

(ii) you derive benefits or are deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with common shares that
are taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities performed in The Netherlands.

_Non-resident Entities_

If you are a corporate entity, or an entity including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund, taxable
as a corporate entity, which is neither resident, nor deemed to be resident of The Netherlands for purposes of
Dutch corporation tax, you will not be subject to Dutch corporation tax in respect of any benefits derived or
deemed to be derived from or in connection with your common shares, except if:

(i) you derive profits from an enterprise directly which is carried on in whole or in part, through a
permanent establishment or a permanent representative which is taxable in The Netherlands, and to
which permanent establishment or permanent representative your common shares are attributable;
or

(ii) you derive profits pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise which is managed in
The Netherlands, other than as a holder of securities, and to which enterprise your common shares
are attributable.

_General_

If you are neither a Dutch Resident Individual nor a Dutch Resident Entity, you will for Dutch tax
purposes not carry on or be deemed to carry on an enterprise, in whole or in part, through a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in The Netherlands by reason only of acquisition or ownership of
the common shares.

**Dividend withholding tax**

_General_

We are generally required to withhold Dutch dividend withholding tax at a rate of 15% from dividends
distributed by us, subject to possible relief under Dutch domestic law, the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union or an applicable Dutch income tax treaty depending on a particular holder of common shares’
individual circumstances. The Dutch dividend withholding tax is for the account of the holder of common
shares.

The concept “dividends distributed by us” as used in this Dutch Taxation paragraph includes, but is not
limited to, the following:

-  distributions in cash or in kind, deemed and constructive distributions and repayments of capital not
recognized as paid-in for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes;

-  liquidation proceeds and proceeds of repurchase or redemption of common shares in excess of the
average capital recognized as paid-in for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes;

-  the par value of common shares issued by us to a holder of common shares or an increase of the par
value of common shares, as the case may be, to the extent that it does not appear that a contribution,
recognized for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, has been made or will be made; and

-  partial repayment of capital, recognized as paid-in for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes, if
and to the extent that there are net profits, unless (a) the general meeting of our shareholders has
resolved in advance to make such repayment and (b) the par value of the common shares concerned
has been reduced by an equal amount by way of an amendment to our articles of association.

95


-----

Table of Contents

If we receive a profit distribution from a qualifying foreign entity, or a repatriation of qualifying foreign
branch profit, that is exempt from Dutch corporation tax and that has been subject to a foreign withholding tax
of at least 5%, we may be entitled to retain a portion of the Dutch dividend withholding tax imposed in respect
of a dividend distributed by us, that ordinarily would be required to be remitted to the Dutch tax authorities.
Such portion is the lesser of:

-  3% of the dividends paid by us in respect of which Dutch dividend withholding tax is withheld; and

-  3% of the qualifying profit distributions grossed up by the foreign tax withheld on such distributions
received from foreign subsidiaries and branches prior to the distribution of the dividend by us
during the current calendar year and the two preceding calendar years (to the extent such
distributions have not been taken into account previously when applying this test).

Holders of common shares are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the general creditability or
deductibility of Dutch dividend withholding tax and, in particular, the impact on such investors of our potential
ability to receive a reduction as described in the previous paragraph.

**Gift and inheritance taxes**

_Dutch Resident Individuals_

Gift or inheritance taxes will arise in The Netherlands with respect to a transfer of common shares by way
of a gift by, or on the death of, a holder of common shares who is a resident or deemed a resident of The
Netherlands at the time of the gift or the holder's death.

_Non-resident Individuals_

No Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax will arise with respect to a transfer of common shares by way
of gift by, or upon the death of, a holder of common shares who is neither a resident nor deemed to be a resident
of The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax except if, in the event of a gift whilst
not being a resident nor being a deemed resident of The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax or Dutch
inheritance tax, the holder of common shares becomes a resident or a deemed resident of The Netherlands and
dies within 180 days after the date of the gift.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax and Dutch inheritance tax, a gift of common shares made under a condition
precedent is deemed to be made at the time the condition precedent is satisfied.

**Value added tax (VAT)**

No Dutch VAT will be payable by a holder of common shares in respect of any payment in consideration
for the ownership or disposal of the common shares.

**Other taxes and duties**

No Dutch registration tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty will be payable by a
holder of common shares in respect of any payment in consideration for the ownership or disposal of the
common shares.

**United States Federal Income Taxation**

The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to a
U.S. holder (as defined below) of the ownership and disposition of our common shares. You are a U.S. holder
only if you are a beneficial owner of common shares:

-  that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (a) a citizen or individual resident of the United States,
(b) a U.S. domestic corporation or a U.S. domestic entity taxable as a corporation, (c) an estate, the
income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (d) a trust, if a
court within the United States can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust;

-  that owns, directly, indirectly or by attribution, less than 10% of our voting power or outstanding
share capital;

-  that holds the common shares as capital assets;

-  whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is the U.S. dollar;

-  that is a resident of the United States and not also a resident of The Netherlands for purposes of the
U.S./NL Income Tax Treaty;

-  that is entitled, under the “limitation on benefits” provisions contained in the U.S./NL Income Tax
Treaty, to the benefits of the U.S./NL Income Tax Treaty; and

-  that does not have a permanent establishment or fixed base in The Netherlands.

This summary does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your
particular circumstances. Also, it does not address holders that may be subject to special rules including, but not
limited to, U.S. expatriates, tax-exempt organizations, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, banks,
securities broker-dealers, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, insurance companies, traders in
securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting, persons holding our common shares as
part of a straddle, hedging or conversion transaction, or persons who acquired common shares pursuant to the
exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation. Because this is a general summary, you are
advised to consult your own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and applicable foreign tax
consequences of the ownership and disposition of our common shares. In addition, you are advised to consult
your own tax advisor concerning whether you are entitled to benefits under the U.S./NL Income Tax Treaty.

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated or arrangement as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) holds common shares, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon
the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership that holds
common shares, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of the
ownership and the disposition of common shares.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the U.S./NL Income Tax
Treaty, judicial decisions, administrative pronouncements and existing, temporary and proposed Treasury
regulations as of the date of this Form 20-F, all of which are subject to change or changes in interpretation,
possibly with retroactive effect.

**_Dividends_**

In general, you must include the gross amount of distributions paid (including the amount of any Dutch
taxes withheld from those distributions) to you by us with respect to the common shares in your gross income as
foreign-source taxable dividend income. The amount of any distribution paid in foreign currency (including the
amount of any Dutch withholding tax thereon) will be equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on
the date of actual or constructive receipt by you regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S.
dollars at that time. Gain or loss, if any, realized on a subsequent sale or other disposition of such foreign
currency generally will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss. Special rules govern and specific elections are
available to accrual method taxpayers to determine the U.S. dollar amount includible in income in the case of
taxes withheld in a foreign currency. Accrual basis taxpayers are urged to consult their own tax advisors
regarding the requirements and elections applicable in this regard.

Table of Contents

Subject to applicable limitations, Dutch taxes withheld from a distribution paid to you at a rate not
exceeding the rate provided in the U.S./NL Income Tax Treaty will be eligible for credit against your U.S.
federal income tax liability. As described in “— Taxation — Dutch Taxation” above, under limited
circumstances we may be entitled to retain a portion of the Dutch withholding tax that otherwise would be
required to be remitted to the taxing authorities in The Netherlands. If we withhold an amount from dividends
paid to you that we then are not required to remit to any taxing authority in The Netherlands, the amount in all
likelihood would not qualify as a creditable tax for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We will endeavor to
provide you with information concerning the extent to which we have applied the reduction described above to
dividends paid to you. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to
specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends distributed by us with respect to the common shares
generally will constitute “passive category income” or in the case of certain U.S. holders, “general category
income”. The use of foreign tax credits is subject to complex rules and limitations. In lieu of a credit, a U.S.
holder who itemizes deductions may elect to deduct all of such holder’s foreign taxes in the taxable year. A
deduction does not reduce tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis like a credit, but the deduction for foreign taxes is not
subject to the same limitations applicable to foreign tax credits. You should consult your own tax advisor to
determine whether and to what extent a credit would be available to you.

Certain non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of U.S. federal
income tax in respect of “qualified dividend income”. For this purpose, “qualified dividend income” generally
includes dividends paid by a non-U.S. corporation if, among other things, the U.S. holders meet certain
minimum holding period and other requirements and the non-U.S. corporation satisfies certain requirements,
including either that (i) the shares of the non-U.S. corporation are readily tradable on an established securities
market in the United States, or (ii) the non-U.S. corporation is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive
income tax treaty with the United States (such as the U.S./NL Income Tax Treaty) which provides for the
exchange of information. We currently believe that dividends paid by us with respect to our common shares
should constitute “qualified dividend income” for U.S. federal income tax purposes; however, this is a factual
matter and subject to change. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the availability to you of
a reduced dividend tax rate in light of your own particular situation. A dividends-received deduction will not be
allowed with respect to dividends paid by us to corporate U.S. holders.

**_Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares_**

Upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of common shares, you generally will recognize capital gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in the common shares,
as determined in U.S. dollars. This gain or loss generally will be U.S.-source gain or loss, and will be treated as
long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the common shares for more than one year. If you are an
individual, capital gains generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates if specified
minimum holding periods are met. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

**_Net Investment Income Tax_**

Certain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds
generally will be subject to a 3.8% tax on “net investment income”, including, among other things, dividends
on, and gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of, our common shares, subject to certain limitations and
exceptions. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the effect, if any, of such tax on your ownership
and disposition of our common shares.

**_Passive Foreign Investment Company Status_**

We believe that we should not be classified as a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes for the year ended December 31, 2019 and we do not expect to become a PFIC in
the foreseeable future. This conclusion is a factual determination that must be made annually at the close of
each taxable year and therefore we can provide no assurance that we will not be a PFIC in our current or any
future taxable year. If we were to be characterized as a PFIC for any taxable year, the tax on certain
distributions on our common shares and on any gains realized upon the disposition of common shares may be
materially less favorable than as described herein. In addition, if we were a PFIC in a taxable year in which we
were to pay dividends or the prior taxable year, such dividends would not be “qualified dividend income” (as
described above) and would be taxed at the higher rates applicable to other items of ordinary income. You
should consult your own tax advisor regarding the application of the PFIC rules to your ownership of our
common shares.

**_U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Dividend payments with respect to common shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement or
other disposition of our common shares may be subject to information reporting to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the “IRS”) and possible U.S. backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply to you, however,
if you furnish a correct taxpayer identification number and make any other required certification, or if you are
otherwise exempt from backup withholding. U.S. persons required to establish their exempt status generally
must provide certification on IRS Form W-9. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld
as backup withholding may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, and you may obtain a
refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate
claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.

In addition, U.S. holders should be aware of annual reporting requirements with respect to the holding of
certain foreign financial assets, including our common shares that are not held in an account maintained by
certain types of financial institutions, if the aggregate value of all of such assets exceeds $50,000 (or $100,000
for married couples filing a joint return). You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the application of
the information reporting and backup withholding rules to our common shares and the application of the annual
reporting requirements to your particular situation.

**Item 11.** **Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

We are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business due to our
operations in different foreign currencies and our ongoing investing and financing activities. Market risk is the
uncertainty to which future earnings or asset/liability values are exposed due to operating cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies and various financial instruments used in the normal course of operations.
The major financial risks to which we are exposed are the foreign exchange risks related to the fluctuations of
the U.S. dollar exchange rate compared to the Euro and the other major currencies in which costs are incurred,
the variation of the interest rates and the risks associated to the investments of our available cash. We have
established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of
financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

Our interest income (expense), net, as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Income, is the balance
between interest income received from our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities investments and
interest expense paid on our financial liabilities and bank fees (including fees on committed credit lines). Our
interest income is dependent upon fluctuations in interest rates, mainly in U.S. dollars and Euros, since we
invest primarily on a short-term basis; any increase or decrease in the market interest rates would mean an
equivalent increase or decrease in our interest income. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and
Prospects — Impact of Changes in Interest Rates”.

We place our cash and cash equivalents, or a part of it, with financial institutions with at least a single “A”
long-term rating from two of the major rating agencies, meaning at least A3 from Moody’s and A- from S&P or
Fitch, or better, invested as term deposits and Government securities and, as such, we are exposed to the
fluctuations of the market interest rates on our placement and our cash, which can have an impact on our
accounts. We manage the credit risks associated with financial instruments through credit approvals, investment
limits and centralized monitoring procedures but do not normally require collateral or other security from the
parties to the financial instruments. As of December 31, 2019, the marketable securities have a value of $133
million. They are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value. This fair value measurement
corresponds to a Level 1 fair value hierarchy measurement. The estimated value of these securities could
further decrease in the future as a result of credit market deterioration and/or other downgrading.

We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows resulting from the use of our instruments in the future. There can be no assurance that these strategies will
be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately.

The information below summarizes our market risks associated with cash and cash equivalents, short-term
deposits, marketable securities and debt obligations as of December 31, 2019. The information below should be
read in conjunction with Note 27 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of
maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations (in millions of U.S. dollars, except percentages):

**Disclosure Controls and Procedures**

_Evaluation_

Our management, including the CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (“Disclosure Controls”) as of the end of the period covered by this Form
20-F. Disclosure Controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably assure that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 20-F, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure Controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.

The evaluation of our Disclosure Controls included a review of the controls’ objectives and design, our
implementation of the controls and their effect on the information generated for use in this Form 20-F. The
components of our Disclosure Controls are also evaluated on an ongoing basis by our Corporate Audit
Department, which reports directly to our Audit Committee. The overall goals of these various evaluation
activities are to monitor our Disclosure Controls, and to modify them as necessary. Our intent is to maintain the
Disclosure Controls as dynamic systems that change as conditions warrant.

Based on their evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by
this Form 20-F, our Disclosure Controls were effective.

_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the period covered by this form
20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

_Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls_

No system of internal control over financial reporting, including one determined to be effective, may
prevent or detect all misstatements. It can provide only reasonable assurance regarding financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of the results of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting into future periods are subject to inherent risk. The relevant controls may
become inadequate due to changes in circumstances or the degree of compliance with the underlying policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

**_Other Reviews_**

We have sent this Form 20-F to our Audit Committee and Supervisory Board, which had an opportunity
to raise questions with our management and independent auditors before we filed it with the SEC.

**Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. See Item 3. “Key Information — Risk
Factors”.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2019, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(“COSO”) in Internal _Control-Integrated_ _Framework (2013). Management’s assessment included evaluation of_
such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process
documentation, accounting policies and our overall control environment. The management assessment provided
sufficient insight into any weaknesses in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems
which ensure that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies and identified the material
risks and uncertainties that were relevant for the expectation of the company's continuity for the period of twelve
months following the assessment. Based on this assessment the management concluded that, as of December
31, 2019 our internal control over financial reporting was effective and the financial reporting is prepared on a
going concern basis.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has
been audited by Ernst &Young AG, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Supervisory Board and Stockholders of STMicroelectronics N.V.

**Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

We have audited STMicroelectronics N.V.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,
STMicroelectronics N.V. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of STMicroelectronics N.V. as of December
31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statements
schedule on page S-1, and our report dated February 26, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

**Basis for Opinion**

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**Item 16G. Corporate Governance**

_As we have common shares listed on the NYSE, pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules, in this Item 16G we_
_provide a concise summary of any significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from_
_those followed by U.S. companies under NYSE listing standards._

As a Dutch company, we are subject to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. We have summarized our
policies and practices in the field of corporate governance in our Corporate Governance Charter, including our
corporate organization, the remuneration principles which apply to our Managing and Supervisory Boards, our
information policy and our corporate policies relating to business ethics and conflicts of interests. We are
committed to informing our shareholders of any significant changes in our corporate governance policies and
practices at our AGM. Along with our Supervisory Board Charter (which we last updated in October 2019 and
which also includes the charters of our Supervisory Board Committees) and our Code of Conduct, the current
version of our Corporate Governance Charter is posted on our website (www.st.com), and these documents are
available in print to any shareholder who may request them.

Below is a description of the significant ways our corporate governance practices as a Dutch company
differ from those followed by U.S. companies listed on the NYSE:

-  Because we are a Dutch company, the Audit Committee is an advisory committee to the
Supervisory Board, which reports to the Supervisory Board, and our General Meeting of
Shareholders appoints our statutory auditors. Our Audit Committee has established a charter
outlining its duties and responsibilities with respect to, among others, the monitoring of our
accounting, auditing, financial reporting and the appointment, retention and oversight of our
external auditors. In addition, our Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt,
retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters, and the confidential anonymous submission by our employees regarding questionable
accounting or auditing matters.

-  Pursuant to our Supervisory Board Charter, the Supervisory Board is responsible for handling and
deciding on potential reported conflicts of interests between the Company and members of the
Supervisory Board, as well as the Managing Board. See “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related
Party Transactions”.

-  Our Supervisory Board is carefully selected based upon the combined experience and expertise of
its members. In fulfilling their duties under Dutch law, Supervisory Board members serve the best
interests of all of our stakeholders and of our business and must act independently in their
supervision of our management. Our Supervisory Board has adopted criteria to assess the
independence of its members in accordance with corporate governance listing standards of the
NYSE. Our Supervisory Board has on various occasions discussed Dutch corporate governance
standards, the implementing rules and corporate governance standards of the SEC and of the NYSE,
as well as other corporate governance standards. The Supervisory Board has determined, based on
the evaluations by an ad hoc committee, the following independence criteria for its members:
Supervisory Board members must not have any material relationship with STMicroelectronics N.V.,
or any of our consolidated subsidiaries, or our management. A “material relationship” can include
commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships,
among others, but does not include a relationship with direct or indirect shareholders.

We believe we are fully compliant with all material NYSE corporate governance standards, to the extent
possible for a Dutch company listed on Euronext Paris, Borsa Italiana, as well as the NYSE.

Our consistent commitment to good corporate governance principles is evidenced by:

-  Our corporate organization under Dutch law that entrusts our management to a Managing Board
acting under the supervision and control of a Supervisory Board totally independent from the
Managing Board. Members of our Managing Board and of our Supervisory Board are appointed
and dismissed by our shareholders;

-  Our early adoption of policies on important issues such as business ethics and conflicts of interest
and strict policies to comply with applicable regulatory requirements concerning financial reporting,
insider trading and public disclosures;

Table of Contents

-  Our compliance with Dutch securities laws, because we are a company incorporated under the laws
of The Netherlands, as well as our compliance with American, French and Italian securities laws, as
applicable, because our shares are listed in these jurisdictions, in addition to our compliance with
the corporate, social and financial laws applicable to our subsidiaries in the countries in which we
do business;

-  Our broad-based activities in the field of corporate social responsibility, encompassing
environmental, social, health, safety, educational and other related issues including our corporate
governance statement which evidences our policy objectives with respect to diversity as well as the

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

**To the Supervisory Board and Stockholders of STMicroelectronics N.V.**

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of STMicroelectronics N.V. (the Company) as
of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes
and financial statements schedule on page S-1 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial
statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019,
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 26, 2020
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

**Basis for Opinion**

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Critical Audit Matter**

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial
statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in
any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the
accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

_Recoverability of deferred tax assets_

_Description of the Matter:_ At December 31, 2019 the Company reports deferred tax assets of
$695 million. As explained in note 2.7 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company performs an evaluation of the likelihood
that future taxable income will be generated in an amount sufficient
to utilize such deferred tax assets prior to their expiration, and, after
having considered positive and negative available evidence, records
a valuation allowance for any deferred tax assets not deemed
recoverable.

Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets involves
significant judgement and estimates, including, among others: the
prospective financial information used by management in order to
assess future taxable income, transfer pricing policies and the
timing of reversal of temporary differences. These assumptions
have a high degree of uncertainty and subjectivity, since they are
dependent on the outcome of future events.

_How We Addressed the Matter_

_In Our Audit:_ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the
operating effectiveness of management’s controls around, among
others: the calculation of the gross amount of deferred tax assets
recorded, the preparation of the prospective financial information
used to determine the Company’s future taxable income and the
assessment of valuation allowance needed for deferred tax assets
not deemed recoverable.

We involved tax professionals to assist with our procedures in
evaluating management’s assessment around the realizability of
deferred tax assets by weighting available positive and negative
evidence. Among other procedures, we evaluated the timing of the
reversal of the temporary differences and management’s prospective
financial information used to determine future taxable income and
its consistency with current transfer pricing policies. We compared
the projections of future taxable income with the actual results of
prior periods, as well as management’s consideration of current and
expected industry and economic trends. We also assessed the
historical accuracy of management’s projections.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

(In millions of U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts)

**1.** **THE COMPANY**

STMicroelectronics N.V. (the "Company") is registered in The Netherlands with its corporate legal seat in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and its corporate headquarters located in Geneva, Switzerland.

The Company is a global independent semiconductor company that designs, develops, manufactures and
markets a broad range of products, including discrete and standard commodity components, application-specific
integrated circuits (“ASICs”), full custom devices and semi-custom devices and application-specific standard
products (“ASSPs”) for analog, digital and mixed-signal applications. In addition, the Company participates in
the manufacturing value chain of smartcard products, which includes the production and sale of both silicon
chips and smartcards.

**2.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The accounting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All balances and values in the current and prior periods are in millions of
U.S. dollars, except share and per-share amounts. Under Article 35 of the Company’s Articles of Association,
the financial year extends from January 1 to December 31, which is the period-end of each fiscal year. Certain
prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

**2.1 - Principles of consolidation**

The Company's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash
flows of its majority-owned subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is
transferred to the Company. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company assesses each investment in equity securities to determine whether the investee is a Variable
Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Company consolidates the VIEs for which the Company is determined to be the
primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that: (i) has the power to direct the most
significant activities of the VIE and (ii) is obligated to absorb losses or has the rights to receive returns that
would be considered significant to the VIE. Assets, liabilities, and the noncontrolling interest of newly
consolidated VIEs are initially measured at fair value in the same manner as if the consolidation resulted from a
business combination.

When the Company owns some, but not all, of the voting stock of a consolidated entity, the shares held by third
parties represent a noncontrolling interest. The consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the total
amount of assets and liabilities and income and expenses of the consolidated subsidiaries. However, the portion
of these items that does not belong to the Company’s shareholders is reported on the line “Noncontrolling
interest” in the consolidated financial statements.

**2.2 - Use of estimates**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions. The primary areas that require significant estimates and judgments by
management include, but are not limited to:

-  sales returns and allowances,

-  inventory obsolescence reserves and normal manufacturing capacity thresholds to determine costs
capitalized in inventory,

-  recognition and measurement of loss contingencies,

-  valuation at fair value of assets acquired, including intangibles, goodwill, investments and tangible
assets,

F-8

Table of Contents

-  annual and trigger-based impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets, as well as the
assessment, in each reporting period, of events, which could trigger impairment testing on longlived assets,

-  recognition and measurement of restructuring charges and other related closure costs;

-  assumptions used in assessing the number of awards expected to vest on stock-based compensation
plans,

-  assumptions used in calculating pension obligations and other long-term employee benefits,

-  allocation between debt and equity of the various components of an issued, or converted, hybrid
instrument and measurement at fair value of the liability component based on a discount rate
adjustment technique income approach, and

-  determination of the amount of taxes expected to be paid and tax benefit expected to be received,
including deferred income tax assets, valuation allowance and provisions for uncertain tax positions
and claims.

The Company bases the estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors such as
market trends, market information used by market participants and the latest available business plans that it
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. While the Company regularly evaluates its estimates and
assumptions, the actual results experienced by the Company could differ materially and adversely from those
estimates.

**2.3 - Foreign currency**

The U.S. dollar is the reporting currency of the Company. The U.S. dollar is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the Company operates, since the worldwide semiconductor industry uses the
U.S. dollar as a currency of reference for actual pricing in the market. Furthermore, the majority of the
Company’s transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, and revenues from external sales in U.S. dollars
largely exceed revenues in any other currency. However, certain significant costs are largely incurred in the
countries of the Euro zone and other non-U.S. dollar currency areas.

The functional currency of each subsidiary of the Company is either the local currency or the U.S. dollar,
depending on the basis of the economic environment in which each subsidiary operates. Foreign currency
transactions, including operations in local currency when the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, are
measured into the functional currency using the prevailing exchange rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the re-measurement at reporting date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are recognized in the consolidated statements of income on the line “Other income and expenses,
net”.

For consolidation purposes, the results and financial position of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is
different from the U.S. dollar are translated into the reporting currency as follows:

(a) assets and liabilities for each consolidated balance sheet presented are translated at the closing
exchange rate as of the balance sheet date;

(b) income and expenses for each consolidated statement of income presented are translated at the
average monthly exchange rate;

(c) the resulting exchange differences are reported as Currency Translation Adjustments (“CTA”), a
component of “Other comprehensive income (loss)” in the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income.

**2.4 – Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with external financial institutions and
other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities to the Company of three months or less.
They are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present
insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Bank overdrafts are not netted against
cash and cash equivalents and are shown as part of current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

**2.5 - Trade accounts receivable**

Trade accounts receivable are amounts due from customers for goods sold and services rendered to third parties
in the ordinary course of business. They are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company
evaluates its customers’ financial condition periodically and records an allowance for any specific account it
considers as doubtful. Additionally, the Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from its customers’ inability to make required payments. The carrying amount of the receivable
is thus reduced by an allowance account, and the amount of the charge is recognized on the line “Selling,
general and administrative” in the consolidated statements of income. Subsequent recoveries, if any, of amounts
previously provided for are credited against the same line in the consolidated statements of income. When a
trade accounts receivable is uncollectible, it is written-off against the allowance account for trade accounts
receivable.

In the event of transfers of receivables such as factoring, the Company derecognizes the receivables only to the
extent that the Company has surrendered control over the receivables in exchange for a consideration other than
beneficial interest in the transferred receivables.

**2.6 – Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is based on the weighted average cost
by adjusting standard cost to approximate actual manufacturing costs on a quarterly basis; the cost is therefore
dependent on the Company’s manufacturing performance. In the case of underutilization of manufacturing
facilities, the costs associated with the unused capacity are not included in the valuation of inventories but
charged directly to cost of sales. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.

The Company performs, on a continuous basis, inventory write-offs of products, which have the characteristics
of slow-moving, old production dates and technical obsolescence. Indeed, the Company evaluates its product
inventory to identify obsolete or slow-selling items as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality and
records a specific reserve if the Company estimates the inventory will eventually become obsolete. Reserve for
obsolescence is estimated for excess uncommitted inventory based on the previous quarter sales, order backlog
and production plans.

**2.7 - Income taxes**

Income tax for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. Current income tax represents the income
tax expected to be paid or the tax benefit expected to be received related to the current year taxable profit and
loss in each tax jurisdiction. Deferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, for all temporary
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the consolidated
financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of
goodwill. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that are enacted at the balance sheet date
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax
liability is settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from changes in tax laws and tax rates is
recognized on the line “Income tax benefit (expense)” in the consolidated statements of income in the period in
which the law is enacted. Deferred income tax assets are recognized in full, but the Company assesses whether
future taxable profit will be available against which temporary differences can be utilized. A valuation
allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it is more likely than not that they
will not be realized.

Table of Contents

The Company recognizes a deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when there is a
presumption that the earnings will be remitted to the parent. A deferred tax asset is recognized on compensation
for the grant of stock awards to the extent that such charge constitutes a temporary difference in the subsidiaries’
local tax jurisdictions. Changes in the stock price do not impact the deferred tax asset and do not result in any
adjustments prior to vesting.

At each reporting date, the Company assesses all material open income tax positions in all tax jurisdictions to
determine any uncertain tax positions. The Company uses a two-step process for the evaluation of uncertain tax
positions. The first step consists in determining whether a benefit may be recognized; the assessment is based
on a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. If the sustainability is lower than 50%, a full provision should
be accounted for. In case of a sustainability threshold in step one higher than 50%, the Company must perform
a second step in order to measure the amount of recognizable tax benefit, net of any liability for tax
uncertainties. The measurement methodology in step two is based on a “cumulative probability” approach,
resulting in the recognition of the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
settlement with the taxing authority. The unrecognized tax benefit is recorded as a reduction of a deferred tax
asset to the extent that a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is
available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income
taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position. The Company accrues for interest and
penalties on uncertain tax liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheets. Interests and penalties are
classified as components of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.

**2.8 – Assets held for sale**

Asset groups are classified as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. The asset groups are classified as assets held for
sale when the following conditions have been met: management has approved the plan to sell; assets are
available for immediate sale; assets are actively being marketed; sale is probable of occurring within one year;
price is reasonable in the market and it is unlikely that there will be significant changes in the assets to be sold
or a withdrawal to the plan to sell. Asset groups classified as held for sale are reported as current assets in the
consolidated balance sheets at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Long-lived
assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated. When the held-for-sale accounting treatment requires
an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value, such impairment is
reflected on the consolidated statements of income on the line “Impairment, restructuring charges and other
related closure costs”.

**2.9 – Business combinations and goodwill**

The acquisition method of accounting is applied to all business combinations. The identifiable assets acquired,
equity instruments issued, and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Any
contingent purchase price and acquired contingencies are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and
remeasured at each reporting date. Acquisition-related transaction costs and restructuring costs relating to the
acquired business are expensed as incurred. Acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is
capitalized and recorded as an intangible asset on the acquisition date, subject to impairment testing until the
research or development is completed or abandoned. The excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date
fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In case of a bargain
purchase, the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the
liabilities assumed; the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, if any; the Company’s previously held equity
interest in the acquiree, if any; and the consideration transferred. If after this review, a bargain purchase is still
indicated, it is recognized in earnings attributed to the Company. The purchase of additional interests in a
partially owned subsidiary is treated as an equity transaction as well as all transactions concerning the sale of
subsidiary stock or the issuance of stock by the partially owned subsidiary, as long as there is no change in
control of the subsidiary. If as a consequence of selling subsidiary shares, the Company no longer controls the
subsidiary, the Company recognizes a gain or loss in earnings.

Table of Contents

Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested
annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill subject to potential
impairment is tested at a reporting unit level. The impairment test determines whether the fair value of each
reporting unit for which goodwill is allocated is lower than the total carrying amount of relevant net assets
allocated to such reporting unit, including its allocated goodwill. If lower, the implied fair value of the reporting
unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recognized for
any excess in the consolidated statements of income on the line “Impairment, restructuring charges and other
related closure costs”. Significant management judgments and estimates are used in forecasting the future
discounted cash flows associated with the reporting unit, including: the applicable industry’s sales volume
forecast and selling price evolution, the reporting unit’s market penetration and its revenues evolution, the
market acceptance of certain new technologies and products, the relevant cost structure, the discount rates
applied using a weighted average cost of capital and the perpetuity rates used in calculating cash flow terminal
values.

**2.10– Intangible assets with definite useful lives**

Intangible assets subject to amortization include the intangible assets purchased from third parties recorded at
cost and intangible assets acquired in business combinations recorded at fair value. Amortization begins when
the intangible asset is available for use and is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the
intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.

The carrying value of intangible assets with definite useful lives is evaluated whenever changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in
the consolidated statements of income on the line “Impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure
costs” for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The Company evaluates the
remaining useful life of an intangible asset at each reporting date to determine whether events and circumstances
warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.

**_Technologies and licenses_**

Separately acquired trademarks and licenses are recorded at historical cost. Trademarks and licenses acquired in
a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks and licenses have a
definite useful life which ranges from 3 to 7 years and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and
impairment losses, if any.

**_Computer software_**

Separately acquired computer software is recorded at historical cost. Costs associated with maintaining
computer software programs are expensed as incurred and reported as “Cost of sales”, “Selling, general and
administrative”, or “Research and development” in the consolidated statements of income according to their
intended use. The capitalization of costs for internally generated software developed by the Company for its
internal use begins when the preliminary project stage is completed and when the Company, implicitly or
explicitly, authorizes and commits to funding a computer software project. It must be probable that the project
will be completed and will be used to perform the function intended. Amortization on computer software begins
when the software is available for use and is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
life, which does not exceed 4 years.

**2.11– Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment
losses. Property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the
acquisition date. Major additions and improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements and repairs are
expensed and reported as “Cost of sales”, “Selling, general and administrative”, or “Research and development”
in the consolidated statements of income according to their intended use.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on fixed assets is computed using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives, as follows:

Buildings 33 years

Facilities and leasehold improvements 5-10 years

Machinery and equipment 2-10 years

Computer and R&D equipment 3-6 years

Other 2-5 years

Table of Contents

The Company evaluates each period whether there is reason to suspect that tangible assets or groups of assets
held and used might not be recoverable. Several impairment indicators exist for making this assessment, such
as: restructuring plans, significant changes in the technology, market, economic or legal environment in which
the Company operates, available evidence of obsolescence of the asset, or indication that its economic
performance is, or will be, worse than expected. In determining the recoverability of assets to be held and used,
the Company initially assesses whether the carrying value of the tangible assets or group of assets exceeds the
undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets. If exceeded, the Company then evaluates whether an
impairment charge is required by determining if the asset’s carrying value also exceeds its fair value. This fair
value is normally estimated by the Company based on independent market appraisals or the sum of discounted
future cash flows, using market assumptions such as the utilization of the Company’s fabrication facilities and
the ability to upgrade such facilities, change in the selling price and the adoption of new technologies. The
Company also evaluates, and adjusts if appropriate, the assets’ useful lives, at each reporting date or when
impairment indicators are identified.

When property, plant and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the net book value of the assets is
removed from the Company’s books. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds
with the carrying amount and are included in “Other income and expenses, net” in the consolidated statements
of income.

The Company recognizes lease arrangements on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets as a category within
“Property, plant and equipment, net”. Lease arrangements with a sum of lease payments not exceeding $5,000
or a total duration lower than twelve months are excluded from capitalization. Subsequently and for income
statement purposes, leases are classified as either operating or finance leases. Lease arrangements in which the
Company has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Operating
lease expenses are recognized in the consolidated income statements, on a straight-line basis over the lease
period and reported as “Cost of sale”, “Selling, general and administrative”, or “Research and development”,
according to the intended use of the leased asset.

**2.12– Investments in equity securities**

Investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and for which the Company does not
have the ability to exercise significant influence are classified as equity securities measured at fair value through
earnings, as described in Note 2.23. For investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair
values and for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, the Company has
elected to apply the cost-method as a measurement alternative. Under the cost-method of accounting,
investments are carried at historical cost, less impairment adjusted for subsequent observable price changes. An
impairment loss is recorded when there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a
significant adverse effect on the value of the investment. The loss is immediately recorded in the consolidated
statements of income on the line “Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net” and is based on the Company’s
assessment of any significant and sustained reductions in the investment’s value. Gains and losses on
investments sold are determined on the specific identification method and are recorded as a non-operating
element on the line “Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net” in the consolidated statements of income.

Equity-method investments are all entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant
influence but not control, generally representing a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
These investments are valued under the equity-method and are initially recognized at cost. Goodwill on equitymethod investments is included in the carrying value of the investment and is not individually tested for
impairment. The Company’s share in the result of operations of equity-method investments is recognized in the
consolidated statements of income on the line “Income (loss) on equity-method investments” and in the
consolidated balance sheets as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the investments. Where there has been a
change recognized directly in the equity of the investee, the Company recognizes its share in the adjustment,
when applicable, directly in the consolidated statement of equity. The financial statements of the equity-method
investments are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company or with a time lag not exceeding three
months if the investee cannot issue consolidated financial statements within the closing timeframe requirements
of the Company. At each period-end, the Company assesses whether there is objective evidence that its interests
in equity-method investments are impaired. Once a determination is made that an impairment exists, the
Company writes down the carrying value of the equity-method investment to its fair value at the balance sheet
date, which establishes a new cost basis. The fair value of an equity-method investment is measured on a nonrecurring basis using primarily a combination of an income approach, based on discounted cash flows, and a
market approach with financial metrics of comparable public companies.

**2.13– Provisions**

In determining loss contingencies, the Company considers the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability as well
as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of such loss or liability. An estimated loss from a loss
contingency is accrued when information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

**2.14– Long-term debt**

(a) Convertible debt

The Company evaluates at initial recognition of a convertible debt the different components and features of the
hybrid instruments and determines whether certain elements are embedded derivative instruments which require
bifurcation. Components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion based on a
net-share settlement basis are accounted for separately as long-term debt and equity when the conversion feature
of the convertible bonds constitute an embedded equity instrument. When an equity instrument is identified,
proceeds from issuance are allocated between debt and equity by measuring first the liability component and
then determining the equity component as a residual amount. The liability component is measured as the fair
value of a similar nonconvertible debt, which results in the recognition of a debt discount. On subsequent
periods, the Company amortizes the debt discount through earnings on the line “Interest expense, net” of the
consolidated statements of income, using the effective interest method, based on the expected maturity of the
debt. The equity component, reported on the line “Capital Surplus” of the consolidated statement of
shareholders’ equity, is not remeasured.

Debt issuance costs are reported as a deduction of debt. They are subsequently amortized through earnings on
the line “Interest expense, net” of the consolidated statements of income, using the effective interest rate
method.

In case of conversion from the bondholders, the fair value of the consideration transferred is allocated between
the liability component and the equity component. The difference between the carrying amount of the debt at
the settlement date and the fair value of the debt component is recorded in earnings as a loss on debt
extinguishment and reported on the line “Loss on financial instruments, net” of the consolidated statements of
income. The liability component is measured as the fair value of a similar nonconvertible debt prior to
settlement. The reacquired equity component is recorded in equity and reported on the line “Capital Surplus” of
the consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity.

(b) Bank loans

Bank loans and non-convertible senior bonds are recognized at historical cost, net of debt issuance costs
incurred. They are subsequently reported at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of debt
issuance costs) and the redemption value is recognized through earnings on the line “Interest expense, net” of
the consolidated statements of income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

**2.15– Employee benefits**

**_(a) Pension obligations_**

The Company sponsors various pension schemes for its employees. These schemes conform to local regulations
and practices in the countries in which the Company operates. Such plans include both defined benefit and
defined contribution plans. For defined benefit pension plans, the liability recognized in the consolidated
balance sheets is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value
of plan assets. The overfunded or underfunded status of the defined benefit plans are calculated as the
difference between plan assets and the projected benefit obligations. Estimates are used in determining the
assumptions incorporated in the calculation of the pension obligations, which is supported by input from
independent actuaries. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
assumptions are recognized in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” in the consolidated
statements of equity and are charged or credited to income over the employees’ expected average remaining
working lives. Past service costs are recognized immediately in earnings on the line “Other components of
pension benefit costs” of the consolidated income statements, unless the changes to the pension scheme are
conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period (the vesting period). In this case, the
past service costs are recognized in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” in the consolidated
statements of equity and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The net periodic benefit
cost of the year is determined based on the assumptions used at the end of the previous year.

F-14

Table of Contents

For defined contribution pension plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered
pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Company has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit
expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in the future payments is available.

The service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is presented in the same income statement line as other
employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. The other components of the
net periodic benefit cost are presented separately, outside operating income, on the line “Other components of
pension benefit costs” of the consolidated income statements. These elements include: interest cost; expected
return on plan assets; amortization of transition (asset) obligation; amortization of prior service cost;
amortization of net (gain) loss; (gain) loss recognized due to curtailment or settlement and; cost of special
termination benefits.

**_(b) Other post-employment obligations_**

The Company provides post-employment benefits to some of its retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is
usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and to the completion of a
minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using
an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited to income over the
expected average remaining working lives of the related employees.

**_(c) Termination benefits_**

Termination benefits are payable when an employee is involuntarily terminated, or whenever an employee
accepts voluntary termination in exchange for termination benefits. For the accounting treatment and timing
recognition of involuntary termination benefits, the Company distinguishes between one-time termination
benefit arrangements and ongoing termination benefit arrangements. A one-time termination benefit
arrangement is established by a termination plan and applies to a specified termination event. One-time
involuntary termination benefits are recognized as a liability when the termination plan meets certain criteria
and has been communicated to employees. If employees are required to render future service in order to receive
these one-time termination benefits, the liability is recognized ratably over the future service period.
Termination benefits other than one-time termination benefits are termination benefits for which the
communication criterion is not met but that are committed to by management, or termination obligations that are
not specifically determined in a new and single plan. These termination benefits are all legal, contractual and
past practice termination obligations to be paid to employees in case of involuntary termination. These
termination benefits are accrued for when commitment creates a present obligation to others for the benefits
expected to be paid, when it is probable that employees will be entitled to the benefits and the amount can be
reasonably estimated.

In case of special termination benefits related to voluntary redundancy programs, the Company recognizes a
provision for voluntary termination benefits at the date on which the employee irrevocably accepts the offer and
the amount can be reasonably estimated.

**_(d) Profit-sharing and bonus plans_**

The Company recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-sharing plans when a contractual
obligation exists or where there is a past practice that has created a present obligation.

**_(e) Other long-term employee benefits_**

The Company provides long-term employee benefits such as seniority awards in certain countries. The
entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee completing a minimum service period. The
expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Actuarial gains and losses arising
from experience adjustments, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are charged or credited to earnings in the
period of change. These obligations are valued annually with the assistance of independent qualified actuaries.

**_(f) Share-based compensation_**

The Company grants unvested stock awards to senior executives and selected employees. The awards granted
to employees vest over a three-year service period. For certain employees, awards contingently vest upon
achieving certain performance conditions. The Company measures the cost of the awards based on the grantdate fair value of the awards, reflecting the market price of the underlying shares at the date of the grant,
reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the shares during the requisite service
period. That cost is recognized using graded vesting over the period during which an employee is required to
provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period. Compensation is recognized only for
the awards that ultimately vest. The compensation cost is recorded through earnings against equity, under
“Capital surplus” in the consolidated statements of equity. The compensation cost is calculated based on the
number of awards expected to vest, which includes assumptions on the number of awards to be forfeited due to
the employees’ failing to fulfill the service condition, and forfeitures following the non-completion of one or
more performance conditions.

Liabilities for the Company’s portion of payroll taxes are recognized at vesting, which is the event triggering the
payment of the social contributions in most of the Company’s local tax jurisdictions. Employee-related social
charges are measured based on the intrinsic value of the share and recorded at vesting date.

**2.16– Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as “Common stock” within equity on the consolidated balance sheets.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital (treasury stock), the consideration paid, including
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the
Company’s shareholders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.

**2.17– Comprehensive income (loss)**

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a business during a period except those
changes resulting from investment by stockholders and distributions to stockholders. In the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, "Other comprehensive income (loss)" and “Accumulated other
comprehensive income” primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments, temporary unrealized
gains (losses) on debt securities classified as available-for-sale, unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives
designated as cash flow hedge and the impact of recognizing the funded status of defined benefit plans, net of
tax.

**2.18– Revenue Recognition**

Arrangements with customers are considered contracts if all the following criteria are met: (a) parties have
approved the contract and are committed to perform their respective obligations; (b) each party’s rights
regarding the goods or services to be transferred can be identified; (c) payment terms for the goods or services to
be transferred can be identified; (d) the contract has commercial substance and (e) collectability of substantially
all of the consideration is probable. The Company recognizes revenue from products sold to a customer,
including distributors, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product to the
customer. In certain circumstances, the Company may enter into agreements that concern principally revenues
from services, where the performance obligation is satisfied over time. The objective when allocating the
transaction price is to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation (or distinct good or service)
in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange
for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer. The payment terms typically range between 30
and 90 days.

Table of Contents

Consistent with standard business practice in the semiconductor industry, price protection is granted to
distribution customers on their existing inventory of the Company’s products to compensate them for declines in
market prices. The Company accrues a provision for price protection based on a rolling historical price trend
computed on a monthly basis as a percentage of gross distributor sales. This historical price trend represents
differences in recent months between the invoiced price and the final price to the distributor, adjusted if
required, to accommodate a significant change in the current market price. The short outstanding inventory time
period, visibility into the inventory product pricing and long distributor pricing history have enabled the
Company to reliably estimate price protection provisions at period-end. The Company records the accrued
amounts as a deduction of “Net sales” in the consolidated statements of income at the time of the sale.

The Company’s customers occasionally return the Company’s products for technical reasons. The Company’s
standard terms and conditions of sale provide that if the Company determines that products do not conform, the
Company will repair or replace the non-conforming products, or issue a credit note or rebate of the purchase
price. Quality returns are identified shortly after sale in customer quality control testing. Quality returns are
usually associated with end-user customers, not with distribution channels. The Company records the accrued
amounts as a deduction of “Net sales” in the consolidated statements of income, using past history and current
conditions to form a reasonable estimate of future returns.

The Company’s insurance policy relating to product liability covers third party physical damages and bodily
injury, indirect financial damages as well as immaterial non-consequential damages caused by defective
products. The Company records a provision for warranty costs as a charge against “Cost of sales” in the
consolidated statements of income, based on historical trends of warranty costs incurred as a percentage of sales,
which management has determined to be a reasonable estimate of the probable losses to be incurred for warranty
claims in a period. Any potential warranty claims are subject to the Company’s determination that the Company
is at fault for damages, and such claims usually must be submitted within a short period of time following the
date of sale. This warranty is given in lieu of all other warranties, conditions or terms expressed or implied by
statute or common law. The Company’s contractual terms and conditions typically limit its liability to the sales
value of the products which gave rise to the claims.

In addition to product sales, the Company enters into arrangements with customers consisting of transferring
licenses or related to license services. The revenue generated from these arrangements are reported on the line
“Other revenues” of the consolidated statement of income. Other revenues also include patent royalty income,
sale of scrap materials and manufacturing by-products.

**2.19– Funding**

The Company receives funding mainly from governmental agencies and income is recognized when all
contractual conditions for receipt of these funds are fulfilled. The Company’s primary sources for government
funding are French, Italian and other country governmental entities. Such funding is generally provided to
encourage research and development activities, industrialization and local economic development. The
conditions for receipt of government funding may include eligibility restrictions, approval by EU authorities,
annual budget appropriations, compliance with European Commission regulations, as well as specifications
regarding objectives and results. Certain specific contracts contain obligations to maintain a minimum level of
employment and investment during a certain period of time. There could be penalties if these objectives are not
fulfilled. Other contracts contain penalties for late deliveries or for breach of contract, which may result in
repayment obligations. Funding related to these contracts is recorded when the conditions required by the
contracts are met. The Company’s funding programs are classified under three general categories: funding for
research and development activities, capital investment, and loans.

Funding for research and development activities is the most common form of funding that the Company
receives. Public funding for research and development is recorded as “Other income and expenses, net” in the
Company’s consolidated statements of income. Public funding for research and development is recognized
ratably as the related costs are incurred once the agreement with the respective governmental agency has been
signed and all applicable conditions are met. Furthermore, French research tax credits (“Crédit Impôt
Recherche”) and Italian research tax credits (“Credito d’Imposta Ricerca & Sviluppo”) are deemed to be grants
in substance. The French research tax credits are to be paid in cash by the taxing authorities within three years
in case they are not deducted from income tax payable during this period of time. The Italian tax credits are
compensated against payroll-related social charges. Unlike other research and development funding, the
amounts to be received are determinable in advance as the funded research expenditures are made. They are
thus reported as a reduction of “Research and development” in the consolidated statements of income.

F-17


-----

Table of Contents

Capital investment funding is recorded as a reduction of “Property, plant and equipment, net” and is recognized
in the Company’s consolidated statements of income according to the depreciation charges of the funded assets
during their useful lives. The Company also receives capital funding in Italy, which can be recovered through
the reduction of various governmental liabilities, including income taxes, value-added tax and employee-related
social charges.

Funding receivables are reported as non-current assets unless cash settlement features of the receivables
evidence that collection is expected within one year. Long-term receivables that do not present any tax attribute
or legal restriction are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at their net present value.

The Company receives certain loans, mainly related to large capital investment projects, at preferential interest
rates. The Company records these loans as “Long-term debt” in the consolidated balance sheets.

**2.20– Advertising costs**

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded as “Selling, general and administrative” in the
consolidated statements of income. Advertising expenses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $17 million, $15
million and $14 million, respectively.

**2.21– Research and development**

Research and development expenses include costs incurred by the Company, the Company’s share of costs
incurred by other research and development interest groups, and costs associated with co-development contracts.
Research and development expenses do not include marketing design center costs, which are accounted for as
“Selling, general and administrative” in the consolidated statements of income and process engineering, preproduction or process transfer costs which are recorded as “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of
income. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The amortization expense recognized on
technologies and licenses purchased by the Company from third parties to facilitate the Company’s research is
reported as “Research and development” in the consolidated statements of income.

**2.22– Start-up and phase-out costs**

Start-up costs represent costs incurred in the start-up, testing and qualification of the Company's newly
integrated manufacturing facilities. The costs of phase-outs are associated with the latest stages of facilities
closure when the relevant production volumes become immaterial. Start-up costs and phase-out costs are
included in "Other income and expenses, net" in the consolidated statements of income.

**2.23– Financial assets**

The Company did not hold at December 31, 2019 and 2018 any financial assets classified as held-to-maturity or
financial assets for which the Company would have elected to apply the fair value option. Consequently, the
Company classified its financial assets in the following categories: trading and available-for-sale. The
classification depends on the nature of the instruments and the purpose for which the financial assets were
acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date – the date on which the Company
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Equity securities measured at fair value through earnings and debt
securities classified as available-for-sale are initially recognized and subsequently carried at fair value.
Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or
have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership; the
relevant gain (loss) is reported as a non-operating element on the consolidated statements of income on the line
“Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net”. The basis on which the cost of a security sold and the amount
reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings, if any, are determined is the specific
identification method.

F-18


-----

Table of Contents

The fair values of quoted debt and equity securities are based on current market prices. If the market for a
financial asset is not active and if no observable market price is obtainable, the Company measures fair value by
using assumptions and estimates. In measuring fair value, the Company makes maximum use of market inputs
and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.

_Financial assets measured at fair value through earnings_

A financial asset is classified in this category if it is a security acquired principally for the purpose of selling in
the short term, an equity security for which the Company has not elected the cost-method measurement
alternative or a derivative instrument not designated as a hedge. Financial assets in this category are classified
as current assets when they are expected to be realized within twelve months of the balance sheet date. Markedto-market gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of trading financial assets are reported in the
consolidated statements of income within “Other income and expenses, net” in the period in which they arise,
when the transactions for such instruments occur within the Company’s operating activities, as it is the case for
trading derivatives that do not qualify as hedging instruments, as described in Note 2.24. Gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets not related to operating activities are presented in the
consolidated statements of income as a non-operating element within “Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net”
in the period in which they arise.

_Debt securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets_

Debt securities are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or are not measured
at fair value through earnings. They are included in current assets when they represent investments of funds
available for current operations or when management intends to dispose of the securities within twelve months
of the balance sheet date.

Changes in fair value, including declines determined to be temporary, of debt securities classified as availablefor-sale are recognized as a component of “Other comprehensive income (loss)” in the consolidated statements
of comprehensive income.

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a debt security or
group of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is impaired. If a credit loss exists, but the Company does
not intend to sell the impaired security and is not more likely than not to be required to sell before recovery, the
impairment is separated into the estimated amount relating to credit loss and the amount relating to all other
factors of declines in fair value. Only the estimated credit loss amount is recognized immediately in earnings,
with the remainder of the loss amount recognized in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in the
consolidated balance sheets. Impairment losses recognized in the consolidated statements of income are not
reversed through earnings.

**2.24– Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities**

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognizing the gain or loss resulting from the derivative
instrument depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the
hedge transaction. The Company has designated certain derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated
with a highly probable forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge).

The Company documents, at inception of the transaction, the relationship between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging
transactions. The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of
whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of hedged items. Derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges are classified as trading
financial assets, as described in Note 2.23.

F-19


-----

Table of Contents

_Derivative financial instruments classified as trading_

The Company conducts its business on a global basis in various major international currencies. As a result, the
Company is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company enters into
foreign currency forward contracts and currency options to reduce its exposure to changes in exchange rates and
the associated risk arising from the denomination of certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at the
Company's subsidiaries. These instruments do not qualify as hedging instruments, and are marked-to-market at
each period-end with the associated changes in fair value recognized in “Other income and expenses, net” in the
consolidated statements of income, as described in Note 2.23.

_Cash Flow Hedge_

As part of its ongoing operating, investing and financing activities, the Company may enter into certain
derivative transactions that may be designated and may qualify as hedging instruments. To reduce its exposure
to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations, the Company hedges certain Euro-denominated forecasted
transactions that cover at the reporting date a large part of its research and development, and selling, general and
administrative expenses as well as a portion of its front-end manufacturing costs of semi-finished goods within
cost of sales through the use of currency forward contracts and currency options, including collars. The
Company also hedges through the use of currency forward contracts certain Singapore dollar-denominated
manufacturing forecasted transactions.

The derivative instruments are designated and qualify for cash flow hedge at inception of the contract and on an
ongoing basis over the duration of the hedge relationship. They are reflected at their fair value as “Other current
assets” or “Other payables and accrued liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets. The criteria for
designating a derivative as a hedge include the instrument’s effectiveness in risk reduction and a one-to-one
matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction with the critical terms of the hedging
instrument matching the terms of the hedged forecasted transaction. This enables the Company to conclude that
changes in cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to be substantially offset by the hedging
instruments.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedge, the change in fair value for the effective portion of the
hedge is reported as a component of “Other comprehensive income (loss)” in the consolidated statements of
comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction
affects earnings, and within the same consolidated statements of income line as the hedged transaction. For
these derivatives, ineffectiveness appears if the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative hedging instrument
exceeds the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the hedged transaction. Effectiveness on
transactions hedged through purchased options is measured on the full fair value of the option, including time
value.

**2.25– Recent accounting pronouncements**

_(a) Accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019_

Lease accounting

The Company adopted on January 1, 2019 ASC 842 guidance on lease accounting by applying the optional
simplified transition method with no cumulative impact recorded in retained earnings at January 1, 2019 and no
restatement of previous periods. In compliance with the new lease accounting guidance, as a lessee, the
Company recognizes lease arrangements on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets as a category within
“Property, plant and equipment, net”. The corresponding lease liabilities are reported on the line “Other longterm liabilities” when payment is expected beyond twelve months, and on the line “Other payables and accrued
liabilities” for the current portion of the lease obligations. For income statement purposes, the new guidance is
still based on a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance leases. Classification
criteria are largely similar to current lease accounting guidance, except that the new guidance does not contain
explicit bright lines. The new guidance has not changed the way operating lease expenses are recognized in the
consolidated income statements, which is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease period and reported as
“Cost of sales”, “Selling, general and administrative”, or “Research and development” in the consolidated
statements of income according to the intended use of the leased asset.

Lessor accounting is similar to the previously applied model, but updated to align with certain changes to the
lessee model and the new revenue recognition guidance. Existing sale-leaseback guidance has been replaced
with a new model applicable to both lessees and lessors. The Company did not report any existing saleleaseback transaction upon adoption. Moreover, the Company is not involved in any significant lease
arrangement in which it acts as a lessor.

Prior to the new guidance adoption, the Company classified as capital leases arrangements in which the
Company had substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Only assets leased under capital leases were
included in “Property, plant and equipment, net” and recorded at the lower of their fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments. The Company did not report any material capital lease arrangement as at
December 31, 2018.

The Company elected the package of transition practical expedients, which allowed the Company not to (1)
reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) reassess the lease classification for
any expired or existing leases and (3) reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. Additionally, the
Company has elected not to allocate the consideration in existing contracts between lease and nonlease
components.

The Company also elected to exclude from capitalization lease arrangements with a sum of lease payments not
exceeding $5,000 or a total duration lower than twelve months. The impact upon adoption was an increase of
property, plant and equipment to reflect the right-of-use assets for the existing lease arrangements, with a
corresponding increase in other payables and accrued liabilities, for the operating lease obligations which
payment is expected within one year, and other long-term liabilities for obligations with payments beyond one
year.  The value of capitalized lease arrangements totaled $206 million as of December 31, 2019, which is
further described in Note 11.

Hedge accounting

The Company adopted on January 1, 2019 the improvements to hedge accounting issued in August 2017. The
changes to existing guidance are intended to align hedge accounting with companies’ risk management
strategies by simplifying the application of hedge accounting and enlarging the scope and results of hedging
programs. The amendments to the existing guidance include designation of hedged items, effectiveness
measurement, presentation and disclosure. The amended guidance has had no material impact on the
Company’s existing foreign-exchange hedge strategy and hedge transactions classified as cash flow hedge.

_(b) Accounting pronouncements expected to impact the Company’s operations that are not yet effective_
_and have not been adopted early by the Company_

In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on measuring credit losses for financial instruments. The
objective of the new guidance is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information
about the expected credit losses on financial instruments, primarily financial assets measured at amortized cost
and available-for-sale debt securities, and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each
reporting date. The amended guidance replaces the current methodology applied in current practice with an
approach that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and
supportable information to inform credit losses estimates. The new guidance is effective for public companies
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. The Company
does not expect any material impact from the new credit impairment model applicable to available-for-sale debt
securities, as the Company only classifies in this category U.S. Treasury debt securities held as marketable
securities. The Company does not expect any material impact which the currently expected credit loss
(“CECL”) model may have on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including cash equivalents, loans and
receivables.

In January 2017, the FASB simplified the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing step 2 of the
goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will
now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The amended guidance is
effective for public companies for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019,
with early application permitted for goodwill impairment tests with measurement dates after January 1, 2017.
The Company will adopt the new guidance when effective and does not expect any material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB clarifies the accounting for costs of implementation activities performed in a cloud
computing arrangement that is a service contract. The amended guidance aligns the requirements for
capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and
hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). The amended guidance is effective for
public companies for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The
Company will adopt the new guidance when effective and is currently finalizing its review of the impact the
amended guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements, which is not expected to be material.

As at December 31, 2019, the Company held $133 million of U.S. Treasury Bonds, all transferred to a financial
institution with high credit quality. These transactions were concluded in compliance with the Company’s
policy to optimize the return on its short-term interest rate investments, always placed with institutions with high
credit rating. The Company, acting as the securities lender, does not hold any collateral on the unsecured
securities lending transactions. The Company retains effective control on the transferred securities. U.S.
Treasury Bonds totaling $200 million matured in 2019. The amount was reported as proceeds from matured
marketable securities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2019.

The debt securities had an average rating of Aaa/AA+/AAA from Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, respectively, with a
weighted average maturity of 1.5 years. The debt securities were reported as current assets on the line
“Marketable Securities” on the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2019, since they represented
investments of funds available for current operations. The bonds were classified as available-for-sale and
recorded at fair value as at December 31, 2019. This fair value measurement corresponds to a Level 1 fair value
hierarchy measurement. The aggregate amortized cost basis of these securities totaled $132 million as at

**7.** **BUSINESS COMBINATION**

In 2019, the Company acquired the Swedish silicon carbide (SiC) wafer manufacturer Norstel AB (“Norstel”).
The purchase consideration, net of $1 million of cash acquired, was funded with available cash. The full
acquisition was executed in two stages. On February 6, 2019, the Company acquired 55% of Norstel’s common
stock, obtaining control over the entity. The fair value of the business as a whole was estimated at $138 million,
of which $77 million was paid by the Company for its majority stake, with an option to acquire the remaining
45% at a later date, subject to certain conditions. On December 2, 2019, the Company exercised its option to
acquire the remaining 45% stake. The Company paid $51 million to complete the closing of the full acquisition.
As of December 31, 2019, an amount of $10 million was held in an escrow account as protection for any claims
and reported as current restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet.

This acquisition will extend the Company’s silicon carbide ecosystem and strengthen the Company’s flexibility
to serve fast growing automotive and industrial applications.

This transaction has been accounted for as a business combination. The activities of this business are included
in the Automotive and Discrete Group (ADG) reportable segment. As of 31 December 2019, completion of the
initial accounting for the business combination remains subject to finalization of the tax impact, if any,
associated with the acquired technology in process. The preliminary fair value of the identifiable assets and
assumed liabilities acquired from Norstel at acquisition date were as follows:


**Fair value**

**recognized at**

**acquisition date**

Property, plant and equipment 11

Technology in process 86

Net working capital (2)

Goodwill[(1)] 43

**Total net assets at fair value** **138**

Purchase consideration 138

(1) The primary item that generated goodwill is the value of the future synergies between Norstel
technology in silicon carbide and the Company, which do not qualify as an amortizable intangible
asset. The goodwill is allocated to the ADG reportable segment as detailed in Note 8.

Tax incentives and capital investment funding, which has reduced property, plant and equipment, has totaled
$54 million, $149 million and $139 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017,
respectively. Tax incentives and public funding reduced depreciation charges by $53 million, $42 million and
$21 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 the Company sold property, plant and equipment for
cash proceeds of $7 million, $1 million and $3 million, respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges of $3 million on long-lived
assets. There was no impairment recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

**11. LEASING**

A lease contract is a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified
property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The
Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease
right-of-use assets within plant, property and equipment. Current operating lease liabilities are included in other
payables and accrued liabilities, while noncurrent operating lease liabilities are included in other long-term
liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment
and long-term debt.

Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease
liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use
assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of
lease payments over the lease term.

The right-of-use asset is a nonmonetary asset while the lease liability is a monetary liability. When accounting
for a lease that is denominated in a foreign currency, the lease liability is remeasured using the current exchange
rate, while the right-of-use asset is remeasured using the exchange rate as of the commencement date.

The Company leases land, buildings, cars and certain equipment (including IT equipment) which have
remaining lease terms between less than one year and 37 years. Certain lease contracts contain options to
extend the leases by up to 30 years, which the Company has included in the lease term when it is reasonably
certain for the Company to exercise that option. In addition, the Company made an accounting policy election
for all the asset classes to not account for the short-term leases. A short-term lease is defined as a lease that, at
the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the
underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. The short-term lease election can only be made
at the commencement date.

Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate are included in the lease payments and are measured
using the prevailing index or rate at the measurement date (January 1, 2019 for initial measurement of the leases
existing at that date and commencement date for subsequent lease contracts). Changes to index and rate-based
variable lease payments are recognized in profit or loss in the period of the change.

Lease contracts with a sum of lease payments not exceeding $5,000 have been excluded from the capitalization
in the balance sheet.

Significant assumptions and judgements may be made in applying the requirements of lease accounting, such as
the exercise of extension options and determination of discount rates.

_Practical expedients_

The Company applied the following practical expedients at standard adoption:

1. Practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for each
separate lease component and the non-lease components associated with that lease component as a
single lease component. This practical expedient was applied to the real estate (land and buildings),
equipment, IT and cars.

2. The package of transition practical expedients (elected as a package and applied consistently to all
leases) not to reassess leases that commenced before the effective date consisting in:

a) No need to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases.

b) No need to reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases.

c) No need to reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases.


3. The transition option allowing to not apply the new leases standard in the comparative periods
presented in the financial statements in the year of adoption.

_Discount rates_

The rate implicit in the lease should be used whenever that rate is readily determinable. In most cases, this rate
is not readily determinable and the Company used its incremental borrowing rate, which was derived from
information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. The
Company gives consideration to its recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with
similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. Discount rates at implementation were
established as of January 1, 2019. Going forward, due to immateriality of any intra-quarter discount rate
changes, the Company will determine the discount rate based on the mid-quarter date.

As of December 31, 2019, finance lease right-of-use asset was less than $1 million. The below information is
presented for the operating leases only.

Operating leases consisted of the following:

_ST-Ericsson SA, in liquidation_

On February 3, 2009, the Company announced the closing of a transaction to combine the businesses of
Ericsson Mobile Platforms and ST-NXP Wireless into a new venture, named ST-Ericsson. As part of the
transaction, the Company received an interest in ST-Ericsson Holding AG in which the Company owned 50%
plus a controlling share. In 2010, ST-Ericsson Holding AG was merged in ST-Ericsson SA.

The Company evaluated that ST-Ericsson SA was a variable interest entity (VIE). The Company determined
that it controlled ST-Ericsson SA and therefore consolidated ST-Ericsson SA.

On September 9, 2013, the Company sold 1 ST-Ericsson SA share to Ericsson for its nominal value changing
the ownership structure of ST-Ericsson SA to bring both partners to an equal ownership proportion. As a result,
and in combination with the new shareholder agreement, the Company lost the control of ST-Ericsson SA and
as such ST-Ericsson SA was deconsolidated from the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The
deconsolidation of ST-Ericsson SA did not result in a gain or loss for the Company. The fair value of the
Company’s retained noncontrolling interest was evaluated at $55 million. In addition, the Company and its
partner signed funding commitment letters, capped at $149 million for each partner, to the residual joint winddown operations to ensure solvency. These were not drawn as of December 20, 2019.

Before the deconsolidation of ST-Ericsson SA, certain assets and companies of the ST-Ericsson SA group of
companies were transferred to both partners for their net book values which were representative of their fair
values. These transactions did not result in cash exchange between the partners.

ST-Ericsson SA entered into liquidation on April 15, 2014. For the years 2019, 2018 and 2017, the line
“Income (loss) on equity-method investments” in the Company’s consolidated statement of income included a
profit of $2 million, $4 million and less than $1 million, respectively, in relation with ST-Ericsson SA.

On December 20, 2019, the Company and Ericsson agreed to complete the wind-down of the joint venture. As
part of the transaction, the Company acquired from ST-Ericsson SA 100% of the share capital of ST-Ericsson
India Pvt Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of ST-Ericsson SA, and simultaneously sold its ST-Ericsson SA
shares to Ericsson. The transaction did not result in a gain or loss for the Company.

**_Other long-term investments_**

Other long-term investments are equity securities with no readily determinable fair value for which the
Company has elected to apply the cost alternative measurement. It includes principally the Company’s
investment in DNP Photomask Europe S.p.A (“DNP”). The Company has identified the joint venture as a VIE,
but has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary. The significant activities of DNP revolve around the
creation of masks and development of high-level mask technology. The Company does not have the power to
direct such activities. The Company’s current maximum exposure to losses as a result of its involvement with
the joint venture is limited to its investment. The Company has not provided additional financial support in
years 2019 and 2018 and currently has no requirement or intent to provide further financial support to the joint

Funding are mainly public grants to be received from governmental agencies in Italy and France as part of longterm research and development, industrialization and capital investment projects. Long-term receivables related
to tax refund correspond to tax benefits claimed by the Company in certain of its local tax jurisdictions, for
which collection is expected beyond one year.

In 2019 and 2018, the Company entered into a factoring transaction to accelerate the realization in cash of some
non-current assets. As at December 31, 2019, $131 million of the non-current assets were sold without
recourse, compared to $122 million as at December 31, 2018, with a financial cost of less than $1 million for
both periods.

a Level 3 fair value hierarchy measurement. The fair value of the liability component at initial recognition
totaled $878 million and was estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows using a discount rate of
2.40% and 3.22% (including 1% per annum nominal interest), respectively, on each tranche, which were
determined to be consistent with the market rates at the time for similar instruments with no conversion rights.
An amount of $121 million, net of allocated issuance costs of $1 million, was recorded in shareholders’ equity
as the value of the conversion features of the instruments.

In the second quarter of 2017, the Company issued a redemption notice to inform bondholders of the early
redemption of the Tranche A bonds in July 2017. As a consequence, bondholders exercised their conversion
rights for $598 million nominal value on the total of $600 million of the Tranche A. The remainder amount of
$2 million was early redeemed in cash by the Company. Each conversion exercised by the bondholders was
net-share settled, upon the Company’s election. As a result, the Company settled $600 million in cash and
approximately 13.0 million shares from treasury shares. The Company allocated the total consideration
transferred between debt and equity by measuring at fair value the liability component of Tranche A prior to
settlement then determining the equity component as a residual amount. The liability component was measured
at fair value based on a discount rate adjustment technique (income approach), which corresponded to a Level 3
fair value hierarchy measurement and consisted in calculating the present value of cash flows using an average
estimated discount rate of 2.09%, which corresponds to current market rates for similar bonds that have no
conversion rights. The fair value of the liability component, as measured prior to extinguishment was $574
million for Tranche A bonds, which generated a loss amounting to $5 million, reported on the line “Loss on
financial instruments, net” in the consolidated statement of income for the period ended December 31, 2017.

Between September 13, 2017 and October 10, 2017, bondholders exercised their conversion rights for $340
million nominal value on the total of $400 million of the Tranche B bonds. On October 11, 2017, the Company
issued a redemption notice to inform bondholders of the early redemption of the remaining $60 million nominal
value of the Tranche B on November 10, 2017. As a consequence, bondholders exercised their conversion
rights for $59 million nominal value on the remaining $60 million of the Tranche B. The remainder amount of
$1 million was early redeemed in cash by the Company. As the Company elected to net share settle the bonds,
each conversion followed the process defined in the original terms and conditions of the convertible bonds,
which determined the actual number of shares to be transferred upon each conversion. As a result, the Company
settled $400 million in cash and approximately 13.7 million shares from treasury shares. The Company
allocated the total consideration transferred between debt and equity by measuring at fair value the liability
component of Tranche B prior to settlement then determining the equity component as a residual amount. The
liability component was measured at fair value based on a discount rate adjustment technique (income
approach), which corresponded to a Level 3 fair value hierarchy measurement and consisted in calculating the
present value of cash flows using an average estimated discount rate of 2.47%, which corresponds to current
market rates for similar bonds that have no conversion rights. The fair value of the liability component, as
measured prior to extinguishment was $370 million for Tranche B bonds, which generated a loss amounting to
$11 million, reported on the line “Loss on financial instruments, net” in the consolidated statement of income
for the period ended December 31, 2017.

On July 3, 2017, the Company issued a $1.5 billion principal amount of dual tranche senior unsecured
convertible bonds (Tranche A and Tranche B for $750 million each tranche), due 2022 and 2024, respectively.
Tranche A bonds were issued at 101.265% as zero-coupon bonds while Tranche B bonds were issued at par and
bear a 0.25% per annum nominal interest, payable semi-annually. The conversion price at issuance was $20.54,
equivalent to a 37.5% premium on both tranches, which corresponds to 9,737 equivalent shares per each
$200,000 bond par value. The bonds are convertible by the bondholders or are callable by the issuer upon
certain conditions, on a net-share settlement basis, except if the issuer elects a full-cash or full-share conversion
as an alternative settlement. The net proceeds from the bond offering were $1,502 million, after deducting
issuance costs payable by the Company. Proceeds were allocated between debt and equity by measuring first
the liability component and then determining the equity component as a residual amount. The liability
component was measured at fair value based on a discount rate adjustment technique (income approach), which
corresponded to a Level 3 fair value hierarchy measurement. The fair value of the liability component at initial
recognition totaled $1,266 million before allocation of issuance costs, and was estimated by calculating the
present value of cash flows using a discount rate of 2.70% and 3.28% (including 0.25% per annum nominal
interest), respectively, on each tranche, which were determined to be consistent with the market rates at the time
for similar instruments with no conversion rights. An amount of $242 million, net of allocated issuance costs of
$1 million, was recorded in shareholders’ equity as the value of the conversion features of the instruments.
Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs on the newly issued convertible debt totaled $146 million as at
December 31, 2019. As at December 31, 2019, the Company stock price exceeded the conversion price of the
convertible bonds.

Aggregate future maturities of total long-term debt (including current portion) at redemption value are as
follows:


**December 31,**

**2019**

2020 173

2021 118

2022 809

2023 59

2024 807

**Thereafter** 252

**Total** **2,218**


The difference between the total aggregated future maturities in the preceding table and the total carrying
amount of long-term debt is due to unamortized debt discount and issuance costs on the dual tranche senior
unsecured convertible bonds.

**_Credit facilities_**

The Company had unutilized committed medium-term credit facilities with core relationship banks totalling
$568 million as of December 31, 2019.

The Company also has three long-term amortizing credit facilities with the European Investment Bank as part of
R&D funding programs. The first one, signed on September 27, 2010, a €350 million multi-currency loan for
R&D programs in Europe, was drawn mainly in U.S. dollars for an amount of $321 million and only partially in
Euros for an amount of €100 million, of which $55 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The
second one, signed on March 12, 2013, a €350 million multi-currency loan which also supports R&D programs,
was drawn in U.S. dollars for $471 million, of which $118 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
The third one, signed in August 2017, is a new long-term credit facility with the European Investment Bank for
a total of €500 million in relation to R&D and capital expenditure investments in the European Union for the
years 2017 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the entire amount was fully drawn in Euros corresponding to
$533 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

**16. POST-EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEES BENEFITS**

The Company and its subsidiaries have a number of defined benefit pension plans, mainly unfunded, and other
long-term employees’ benefits covering employees in various countries. The defined benefit plans provide
pension benefits based on years of service and employee compensation levels. The other long-term employees’
plans provide benefits due during the employees’ period of service after certain seniority levels. The Company
uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans. Eligibility is generally determined in accordance with local
statutory requirements. For Italian termination indemnity plan (“TFR”), generated before July 1, 2007, the
Company continues to measure the vested benefits to which Italian employees are entitled as if they left the
company immediately as of December 31, 2019, in compliance with U.S. GAAP guidance on determining
vested benefit obligations for defined benefit pension plans.

As of December 31, 2019, the number of shares of common stock outstanding was 891,434,489 (898,305,080 at
December 31, 2018).

**17.2 Preference shares**

The 540,000,000 preference shares, when issued, will entitle a holder to full voting rights and to a preferential
right to dividends and distributions upon liquidation.

The Company is a party to an option agreement regarding the preference shares with Stichting Continuïteit ST
(the “Stichting”), entered into on January 22, 2007, with a duration of ten years, which agreement was extended
for another ten years in October 2016. The Managing Board and Supervisory Board, along with the board of the
Stichting, have declared that they are jointly of the opinion that the Stichting is independent of the Company.
The option agreement provides for the issuance of up to a maximum 540,000,000 preference shares. Any such
shares would be issued to the Stichting upon its request and in its sole discretion and upon payment of at least
25% of the par value of the preference shares to be issued. The shares would be issuable in the event of actions
which the board of the Stichting determines would be contrary to the Company’s interests, shareholders and
other stakeholders and which in the event of a creeping acquisition or offer for the Company’s common shares
are not supported by the Company’s Managing Board and Supervisory Board. The preference shares may
remain outstanding for no longer than two years. The effect of the preference shares may be to deter potential
acquirers from effecting an unsolicited acquisition resulting in a change of control as well as to create a levelplaying field in the event actions which are considered to be hostile by the Company’s Managing Board and
Supervisory Board, as described above, occur and which the board of the Stichting determines to be contrary to
the Company’s interests, shareholders and other stakeholders.

There were no preference shares issued as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 respectively.

**17.3 Treasury stock**

In 2014 and 2017, the Company announced share buy-back programs following the issuance of new convertible
bonds. Pursuant to a resolution passed at the shareholders’ meeting held on June 13, 2014, the Company
repurchased 20.0 million shares of its common stock in 2014, reflected at cost, as a reduction of the parent
company stockholders’ equity. Pursuant to a resolution passed at the shareholders’ meeting held on June 20,
2017 and announced on June 22, 2017, the Company repurchased 18.6 million shares of its common stock in
2017 for a total of $297 million, reflected at cost, as a reduction of the parent company stockholders’ equity.

In the second half of 2017, the Company delivered 26.8 million shares from its treasury shares following the
conversion of the Tranche A and Tranche B of the convertible bonds issued on July 3, 2014.

On November 5, 2018, the Company announced a three years buy-back program of up to $750 million. As of
December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 18.3 million shares of its common stock for a total of $312
million under the share buy-back program, reflected at cost, as a reduction of the parent company stockholders’
equity.

The treasury shares have been designated for allocation under the Company’s share-based remuneration
programs of unvested shares. As of December 31, 2019, 53,224,112 of these treasury shares were transferred to
employees under the Company’s share-based remuneration programs, of which 7,014,570 in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company owned 19,752,431 shares classified as treasury stock in the
consolidated statement of equity compared to 12,851,840 shares as of December 31, 2018.

**17.4 Unvested share awards for the Supervisory Board**

On an annual basis and until the year 2012, the Compensation Committee (on behalf of the Supervisory Board
and with its approval) used to grant stock-based awards (the options to acquire common shares in the share
capital of the Company) to the members and professionals of the Supervisory Board (“The Supervisory Board
Plan”). The awards were granted at the nominal value of the share of €1.04 (exercise price of the option). The
options granted under the Supervisory Board Plan vest and become exercisable immediately, while the shares
resulting from these awards vest and therefore become available for trade evenly over three years (one third
every year), with no market, performance or service conditions.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $1 million in
each year. The total intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018

At the Company’s Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 21, 2013, it was resolved to abolish
and terminate the stock-based compensation for the Supervisory Board members and professionals.

**17.5 Unvested share awards for the employees**

On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee (on behalf of the Supervisory Board and with its approval)
grants stock-based awards to the senior executives along with selected employees (the “Employee Plan”). The
awards are granted for services under the Employee Plan. There are two types of unvested shares: (1) shares
granted to employees, which are subject only to service conditions and vest over the requisite service period,
and (2) shares granted to senior executives, whose vesting is subject to performance conditions. For the plans
2017, 2018 and 2019, the performance conditions consisted of two external targets (sales evolution and
operating income compared to a basket of competitors) weighting for two thirds of the total number of awards
granted and of one internal target (return on net assets compared to the previous period), weighting for one third
of the total number of awards granted. For the plan 2016, the performance conditions consisted of two external
targets (sales evolution and operating income compared to a basket of competitors) weighting for 80% of the
total number of awards granted and of two internal targets (days of sales outstanding compared to the budget
and return on net assets compared to budget), weighting for 20% of the total number of awards granted. All the
awards vest over a three-year service period (32% as of the first anniversary of the grant, 32% as of the second
anniversary of the grant and 36% as of the third anniversary of the grant). In addition, in 2016 and 2017, there
was a Special Bonus granted to the Company’s CEO.

(*) As at December 31, 2019, a final determination of the achievement of the performance conditions had
not yet been made by the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board.

A summary of the unvested share activity by plan for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented below:

**Unvested as at** **Cancelled on** **Unvested as at**

**December 31,** **Forfeited /** **failed vesting** **December 31,**

**Unvested Shares** **2018** **Granted** **waived** **conditions** **Vested** **2019**

2016 Employee Plan 1,804,140 — (9,706) — (1,794,434) —

2017 Employee Plan 5,268,975 — (64,290) — (2,556,306) 2,648,379

2018 Employee Plan 7,973,580 — (111,826) — (2,663,830) 5,197,924

2019 Employee Plan — 7,999,690 (22,320) — — 7,977,370

**Total** **15,046,695** **7,999,690** **(208,142)** **—** **(7,014,570)** **15,823,673**


The grant date weighted average fair value of unvested shares granted to employees under the 2016 Employee
Plan was $6.37. On March 28, 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the statement that with respect to
the shares subject to performance conditions, two performance conditions were fully met. Consequently, the
compensation expense recorded on the 2016 Employee Plan reflects the statement that – for the portion of
shares subject to performance conditions – 45% of the awards granted, representing the weight of the two
performance conditions met, will fully vest, as far as the service condition is met.

The grant date weighted average fair value of unvested shares granted to employees under the 2017 Employee
Plan was $16.52. On March 27, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the statement that with respect to
the shares subject to performance conditions, all three performance conditions were fully met. Consequently,
the compensation expense recorded on the 2017 Employee Plan reflects the statement that – for the portion of
shares subject to performance conditions – 100% of the awards granted will fully vest, as far as the service
condition is met.

The grant date weighted average fair value of unvested shares granted to employees under the 2018 Employee
Plan was $22.78. On March 27, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the statement that with respect to
the shares subject to performance conditions, all three performance conditions were fully met. Consequently,
the compensation expense recorded on the 2018 Employee Plan reflects the statement that – for the portion of
shares subject to performance conditions – 100% of the awards granted will fully vest, as far as the service
condition is met.

The grant date weighted average fair value of unvested shares granted to employees under the 2019 Employee
Plan was $19.28. Moreover, for the portion of the shares subject to performance conditions (3,550,300 shares)
the Company estimates the number of awards expected to vest by assessing the probability of achieving the
performance conditions. At December 31, 2019, a final determination of the achievement of the performance
conditions had not yet been made by the Compensation Committee of the Supervisory Board. However, the
Company has estimated that two thirds of the awards subject to performance conditions are expected to vest.
Consequently, the compensation expense recorded for the 2019 Employee Plan reflects the vesting of the two
thirds of the awards granted with performance conditions, subject to the service condition being met. The
assumption of the expected number of awards to be vested upon achievement of the performance conditions is
subject to changes based on the final measurement of the conditions, which is expected to occur in the first half
of 2020.

applications. In addition, the Company participates in the manufacturing value chain of Smartcard products,
which includes the production and sale of both silicon chips and Smartcards.

The principal activities – separated by reportable segments – from which the Company generates its revenues
are described in Note 19.

Other revenues consist of license revenue, service revenue related to transferring licenses, patent royalty
income, sale of scrap materials and manufacturing by-products.

While the majority of the Company’s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, the Company
may, from time to time, enter into agreements that contain multiple performance obligations or terms and
conditions. Those agreements concern principally the revenues from services, where the performance obligation
is satisfied over time. The objective when allocating the transaction price is to allocate the transaction price to
each performance obligation (or distinct good or service) in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the
customer.

**18.2 Revenue recognition and disaggregation**

The Company recognizes revenue from products sold to a customer, including distributors, when it satisfies a
performance obligation at a point in time by transferring control over a product to the customer. This usually
occurs at the time of shipment. The performance obligations linked to the sale of goods contracts have the
original expected length of less than one year. The transaction price is determined based on the contract terms,
adjusted for price protection if applicable. The revenues from services are usually linked to performance
obligations transferred over time and are recognized in line with the contract terms.

The payment terms typically range between 30 and 90 days.

**20. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET**

Other income and expenses, net consisted of the following:





**Year ended** **Year ended** **Year ended**

**December 31,** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**2019** **2018** **2017**

Research and development funding 132 52 65

Phase-out and start-up costs (38) (1) (8)

Exchange gain (loss), net — 4 4

Patent costs (1) (8) (9)

Gain on sale of businesses and non-current assets 7 8 4

Other, net 3 (2) (1)

**Total** **103** **53** **55**

The Company receives significant public funding from governmental agencies in several jurisdictions. Public
funding for research and development is recognized ratably as the related costs are incurred once the agreement
with the respective governmental agency has been signed and all applicable conditions have been met. R&D
funding received in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the Nano2017 program with the French
government is subject to a financial return in the year 2024 and depends on the future cumulative sales of a
certain product group from 2019 to 2024. As such, an accrual amounting to $47 million was recorded as of
December 31, 2019 compared to $42 million as of December 31, 2018.

Phase-out costs are costs incurred during the closing stage of a Company’s manufacturing facility. They are
treated in the same manner as start-up costs. Start-up costs represent costs incurred in the start-up and testing of
the Company’s new manufacturing facilities, before reaching the earlier of a minimum level of production or six
months after the fabrication line’s quality certification.

Exchange gains and losses, net represent the portion of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in
currencies other than an entity’s functional currency and the changes in fair value of trading derivative
instruments which are not designated as hedge and which have a cash flow effect related to operating
transactions, as described in Note 27.

Patent costs include legal and attorney fees and payment for claims, patent pre-litigation consultancy and legal
fees. They are reported net of settlements, if any, which primarily include reimbursements of prior patent
litigation costs.

In 2019, gain on sale of businesses and non-current assets was related to the sale of one of our non-strategic
assets. In 2018, it was related to the sale of one of the Company’s non-strategic investments while in 2017, it
was related to the sale of assets.

**21. IMPAIRMENT, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER RELATED CLOSURE COSTS**

Impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs incurred in 2019, 2018 and 2017 are
summarized as follows:

**Year ended** **Year ended** **Year ended**

**December 31,** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**2019** **2018** **2017**

Research and development funding 132 52 65

Patent costs (1) (8) (9)

Gain on sale of businesses and non-current assets 7 8 4

Other, net 3 (2) (1)

**Total** **103** **53** **55**

The Company receives significant public funding from governmental agencies in several jurisdictions. Public
funding for research and development is recognized ratably as the related costs are incurred once the agreement
with the respective governmental agency has been signed and all applicable conditions have been met. R&D
funding received in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the Nano2017 program with the French
government is subject to a financial return in the year 2024 and depends on the future cumulative sales of a
certain product group from 2019 to 2024. As such, an accrual amounting to $47 million was recorded as of
December 31, 2019 compared to $42 million as of December 31, 2018.

Phase-out costs are costs incurred during the closing stage of a Company’s manufacturing facility. They are
treated in the same manner as start-up costs. Start-up costs represent costs incurred in the start-up and testing of
the Company’s new manufacturing facilities, before reaching the earlier of a minimum level of production or six
months after the fabrication line’s quality certification.

Exchange gains and losses, net represent the portion of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in
currencies other than an entity’s functional currency and the changes in fair value of trading derivative
instruments which are not designated as hedge and which have a cash flow effect related to operating
transactions, as described in Note 27.

Patent costs include legal and attorney fees and payment for claims, patent pre-litigation consultancy and legal
fees. They are reported net of settlements, if any, which primarily include reimbursements of prior patent
litigation costs.

In 2019, gain on sale of businesses and non-current assets was related to the sale of one of our non-strategic
assets. In 2018, it was related to the sale of one of the Company’s non-strategic investments while in 2017, it
was related to the sale of assets.

**21. IMPAIRMENT, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER RELATED CLOSURE COSTS**

Impairment, restructuring charges and other related closure costs incurred in 2019, 2018 and 2017 are
summarized as follows:

The “Tax credits granted on past capital investments” mainly related to a 2003 agreement granting the Company
certain tax credits for capital investments purchased through the year ending December 31, 2006. Any unused
tax credits granted under the agreement will be impacted yearly by a legal inflationary index (currently -0.18%
per annum). The credits may be utilized through 2020 or later depending on the Company meeting certain
program criteria. In addition to this agreement, starting in 2007 the Company continues to receive tax credits on
the yearly capital investments, which may be used to offset that year’s tax liabilities and increases by the legal
inflationary rate. However, pursuant to the inability to utilize these credits currently and in future years, the
Company did not recognize any deferred tax asset on such tax allowance. As a result, there is no financial
impact to the net deferred tax assets of the Company.

The amounts of deferred tax benefit (expense) recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss)
was $6 million in 2019 and $7 million in 2018, respectively. They were related primarily to the tax effects of
the recognized unfunded status on defined benefits plan.

The cumulative amount of distributable earnings related to the Company’s investments in foreign subsidiaries
and corporate joint ventures was $3,628 million and $2,863 million as at December 31, 2019 and December 31,
2018, respectively. Due to the Company’s legal and tax structure, with the parent company established in the
Netherlands, there was no significant tax impact from the distribution of earnings from investments in foreign
subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. This is because there is no tax impact on dividends paid up to a Dutch
holding company.

A reconciliation of 2019, 2018 and 2017 beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as
follows:





**December 31,** **December 31,** **December 31,**

**2019** **2018** **2017**

**Balance at beginning of year** 38 333 258

Additions based on tax positions related to the
current year 7 43 43

Additions based on acquisitions related to the
current year 5 — —

Additions for tax positions of prior years 1 8 12

Reduction for tax positions of prior years (1) (310) (9)

Settlements (2) (18) (2)

Prepayment / Refund — — —

Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations — — —

Foreign currency translation — (18) 31

**Balance at end of year** **48** **38** **333**

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $21 million and $20 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits were
classified as a reduction of deferred tax assets. The finalisation in the fourth quarter of 2018 of pending tax
litigations triggered the reversal of uncertain tax positions in major tax jurisdictions for a total amount of $310
million. It is reasonably possible that certain of the uncertain tax positions disclosed in the table above could
increase within the next 12 months due to ongoing tax audits. The Company is not able to make an estimate of
the range of the reasonably possible change.

Additionally, the Company elected to classify accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as
components of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income, they were less than $1 million in
2019, $1 million in 2018, less than $1 million in 2017, $1 million in 2016, $1 million in 2015, $27 million in
2014 and not material in the previous years. Accrued interest and penalties amounted to $6 million at December
31, 2019 and $5 million at December 31, 2018.

The tax years that remain open for review in the Company’s major tax jurisdictions, including France, Italy,
United States and India, are from 1997 to 2019.

The Company has received and may in the future receive communications alleging possible infringements of
third party patents or other third party intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Company from time to time
enters into discussions regarding a broad patent cross license arrangement with other industry participants.
There is no assurance that such discussions may be brought to a successful conclusion and result in the intended
agreement. The Company may become involved in costly litigation brought against the Company regarding
patents, mask works, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. In the event that the outcome of any litigation
would be unfavorable to the Company, the Company may be required to take a license to third party patents
and/or other intellectual property rights at economically unfavorable terms and conditions, and possibly pay
damages for prior use and/or face an injunction, all of which individually or in the aggregate could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial position and/or ability to
compete. The Company is otherwise also involved in various lawsuits, claims, inquiries, inspections,
investigations and/or proceedings incidental to its business and operations. Such matters, even if not
meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial or managerial resources. Any of the
foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or its
financial position.

The Company regularly evaluates claims and legal proceedings together with their related probable losses to
determine whether they need to be adjusted based on the current information available to the Company. There
can be no assurance that its recorded reserves will be sufficient to cover the extent of its potential liabilities.
Legal costs associated with claims are expensed as incurred. In the event of litigation which is adversely
determined with respect to the Company’s interests, or in the event the Company needs to change its evaluation
of a potential third-party claim, based on new evidence or communications, a material adverse effect could
impact its operations or financial condition at the time it were to materialize.

As of December 31, 2019, provisions for estimated probable losses with respect to claims and legal proceedings
were not considered material.

**27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT**

**27.1 Financial risk factors**

The Company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business due to its
operations in different foreign currencies and its ongoing investing and financing activities. The Company’s
activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value interest
rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk
management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize potential
adverse effects on the Company’s financial performance. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
hedge certain risk exposures.

Financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (Corporate Treasury). Additionally, a
Treasury Committee, chaired by the CFO, steers treasury activities and ensures compliance with corporate
policies. Treasury activities are thus regulated by the Company’s policies, which define procedures, objectives
and controls. The policies focus on the management of financial risk in terms of exposure to market risk, credit
risk and liquidity risk. Treasury controls are subject to internal audits. Most treasury activities are centralized,
with any local treasury activities subject to oversight from Corporate Treasury. Corporate Treasury identifies,
evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Company’s operating units. It provides
written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, price risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments, and
investments of excess liquidity. The majority of cash and cash equivalents is held in U.S. dollars and Euros and
is placed with financial institutions rated at least a single “A” long-term rating from two of the major rating
agencies, meaning at least A3 from Moody’s Investor Service and A- from Standard & Poor’s and Fitch
Ratings, or better. These ratings are closely and continuously monitored in order to manage exposure to the
counterparty’s risk. Hedging transactions are performed only to hedge exposures deriving from operating,
investing and financing activities conducted in the normal course of business.

**_Market risk_**

_Foreign exchange risk_

The Company conducts its business on a global basis in various major international currencies. As a result, the
Company is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the
Euro. Foreign exchange risk mainly arises from recognized assets and liabilities at the Company’s subsidiaries
and future commercial transactions.

Management has set up a policy to require the Company’s subsidiaries to hedge their entire foreign exchange
risk exposure with the Company through financial instruments transacted or overseen by Corporate Treasury.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities,
subsidiaries use forward contracts and purchased currency options. Foreign exchange risk arises when
recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency. These
instruments do not qualify as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Forward contracts and currency
options, including collars, are also used by the Company to reduce its exposure to U.S. dollar fluctuations in
Euro-denominated forecasted intercompany transactions that cover a large part of its research and development,
selling, general and administrative expenses as well as a portion of its front-end manufacturing costs of semifinished goods. The Company also hedges through the use of currency forward contracts certain Singapore
dollar-denominated manufacturing forecasted transactions. The derivative instruments used to hedge these
forecasted transactions meet the criteria for designation as cash flow hedge. The hedged forecasted transactions
have a high probability of occurring for hedge accounting purposes.

It is the Company’s policy to have the foreign exchange exposures in all the currencies hedged month by month
against the monthly standard rate. At each month end, the forecasted flows for the coming month are hedged
together with the fixing of the new standard rate. For this reason, the hedging transactions will have an
exchange rate very close to the standard rate at which the forecasted flows will be recorded on the following
month. As such, the foreign exchange exposure of the Company, which consists in the balance sheet positions
and other contractually agreed transactions, is always close to zero and any movement in the foreign exchange
rates will not therefore influence the exchange effect on items of the consolidated statement of income. Any
discrepancy from the forecasted values and the actual results is constantly monitored and prompt actions are
taken, if needed.

_Derivative Instruments Not Designated as a Hedge_

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in exchange rates
and the associated risk arising from the denomination of certain assets and liabilities in foreign currencies in the
Company’s subsidiaries. These include receivables from international sales by various subsidiaries, payables
for foreign currency-denominated purchases and certain other assets and liabilities arising from intercompany
transactions.

The notional amount of these financial instruments totaled $575 million, $376 million and $644 million at
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The principal currencies covered at the end of the year 2019
are the Euro, the Singapore dollar, the Japanese yen, the China Yuan Renminbi, the Indian rupee, the Swiss
franc, the Malaysian ringgit, the South Korean won, the Philippines peso and the Taiwan dollar.

The risk of loss associated with forward contracts is equal to the exchange rate differential from the time the
contract is entered into until the time it is settled. The risk of loss associated with purchased currency options is
equal to the premium paid when the option is not exercised.

Foreign currency forward contracts not designated as cash flow hedge outstanding as of December 31, 2019
have remaining terms of 6 days to 121 days, maturing on average after 30 days.

_Derivative Instruments Designated as a Hedge_

To further reduce its exposure to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations, the Company hedges through the use of
currency forward contracts and currency options, including collars, certain Euro-denominated forecasted
intercompany transactions that cover at year-end a large part of its research and development, selling, general
and administrative expenses, as well as a portion of its front-end manufacturing costs of semi-finished goods
within cost of sales. The Company also hedges through the use of currency forward contracts certain
manufacturing transactions within cost of sales denominated in Singapore dollars.

The principles regulating the hedging strategy for derivatives designated as cash flow hedge are established as
follows: (i) for R&D and corporate costs, up to 80% of the total forecasted transactions; (ii) for manufacturing
costs, up to 70% of the total forecasted transactions. In order to follow a dynamic hedge strategy, the Company
may change the percentage of the designated hedged item within the limit of 100% of the forecasted transaction.
The maximum length of time over which the Company could hedge its exposure to the variability of cash flows
for forecasted transactions is 24 months.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an increase in cost of sales of $51 million and an
increase in operating expenses of $28 million, related to the realized losses incurred on such hedged
transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a decrease in cost of sales of $4
million and an increase in operating expenses of $3 million, related to the realized gains (losses) incurred on
such hedged transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a decrease in cost of
sales of $16 million and a decrease in operating expenses of $14 million, related to the realized gains incurred
on such hedged transactions. No significant ineffective portion of the hedge was recorded on the line “Other
income and expenses, net” of the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2019,
2018 and 2017.

The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts and currency options, including collars, designated
as cash flow hedge totaled $1,328 million, $1,597 million and $1,393 million at December 31, 2019, 2018 and
2017, respectively. The forecasted transactions hedged at December 31, 2019 were determined to have a high
probability of occurring.

As of December 31, 2019, $3 million of deferred losses on derivative instruments included in “Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss)” were expected to be reclassified as earnings during the next 12 months
based on the monthly forecasted research and development expenses, corporate costs and semi-finished
manufacturing costs. No amount was reclassified as “Other income and expenses, net” into the consolidated
statement of income from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” in the consolidated statement of
equity. Foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and collars designated as cash flow hedge
outstanding as of December 31, 2019 have remaining terms of 6 days to 15 months, maturing on average after
126 days.

As at December 31, 2019, the Company had the following outstanding derivative instruments that were entered
into to hedge Euro-denominated and Singapore dollar-denominated forecasted transactions:

**Notional amount for hedge on**

**forecasted R&D and other** **Notional amount for hedge on**

**In millions of Euros** **operating expenses** **forecasted manufacturing costs**

Forward contracts 203 333

Currency collars 243 309


**In millions of Singapore dollars** **Notional amount for hedge on**

**forecasted R&D and other** **Notional amount for hedge on**

**operating expenses** **forecasted manufacturing costs**

Forward contracts — 143


_Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk_

The Company’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose
the Company to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Company to fair value
interest rate risk.

The Company analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis. Various scenarios are simulated taking
into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging. The Company
invests primarily on a short-term basis and as such the Company’s liquidity is invested in floating interest rate
instruments. As a consequence, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk due to potential mismatch between
the return on its short term floating interest rate investments and the portion of its long term debt issued at fixed
rate.

No significant ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge relationships was recorded in earnings for the years
ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. No amount was excluded from effectiveness measurement
on foreign exchange forward contracts and collars.

The effect on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31,
2018 of derivative instruments not designated as a hedge is presented in the table below:

**Location of gain recognized in earnings** **Gain recognized in earnings**

**December 31,** **December 31,**

**2019** **2018**

Foreign exchange forward contracts Other income and expenses, net 1 9

Total 1 9


The Company did not enter into any derivative containing significant credit-risk-related contingent features.

The Company entered into currency collars as combinations of two options, which are reported, for accounting
purposes, on a net basis. The fair value of these collars represented as at December 31, 2019 assets totalling $1
million (a gross amount of $2 million recognized as assets offset with a liability of $1 million) and liabilities
totalling $2 million (a gross amount of $2 million recognized as liabilities with a nil asset amount). In addition,
the Company entered into other derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, which are governed by
standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) agreements, which are not offset in the
statement of financial position and representing total assets of $7 million and liabilities of $5 million as at
December 31, 2019.

_Credit risk_

The Company selects banks and/or financial institutions that operate with the group based on the criteria of
long-term rating from at least two major Rating Agencies and keeping a maximum outstanding amount per
instrument with each bank not to exceed 20% of the total.

The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course
of business. If certain customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no
independent rating, risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial
position, past experience and other factors. Individual risk limits are set based on internal and external ratings in
accordance with limits set by management. The utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. Sales to
customers are primarily settled in cash. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, no customer represented more than
10% of trade accounts receivable, net. Any remaining concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas.

_Liquidity risk_

Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash equivalents and marketable securities,
the availability of funding from committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The
Company’s objective is to maintain a significant cash position and a low debt-to-equity ratio, which ensure
adequate financial flexibility. Liquidity management policy is to finance the Company’s investments with net
cash provided from operating activities.

Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity reserve based on expected cash flows.

**27.2 Capital risk management**

The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to create value for shareholders and benefits and returns for other stakeholders, as to maintain
an optimal capital structure. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may review the
amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or issue new shares.

Consistent with others in the industry, the Company monitors capital on the basis of the net debt-to-equity ratio.
This ratio is calculated as the net financial position of the Company, defined as the difference between total cash
position (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities – current and non-current – and current restricted
cash, if any) net of total financial debt (bank overdrafts, if any, short-term borrowings and current portion of
long-term debt as well as long-term debt), divided by total parent company stockholders’ equity.

**27.3 Fair value measurement**

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance
sheet date. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Company is the bid price. If the
market for a financial asset is not active and if no observable market price is obtainable, the Company measures
fair value by using significant assumptions and estimates. When measuring fair value, the Company makes
maximum use of market inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.

The table below details financial assets (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as at December
31, 2019:

There was no material asset (liability) measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable
inputs (Level 3) as at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

The liability component of the convertible bonds issued on July 3, 2017 was measured at initial recognition at
fair value based on a discount rate adjustment technique (income approach), which corresponds to a Level 3 fair
value hierarchy measurement. The fair value of the liability component at initial recognition totaled $1,266
million before allocation of issuance costs, and was estimated by calculating the present value of cash flows
using a discount rate of 2.70% and 3.28% (including 0.25% per annum nominal interest), respectively, on each
tranche, which were determined to be consistent with the market rates at the time for similar instruments with no
conversion rights. The liability component of the convertible bonds was subsequently reported at amortized
cost.

The Company evaluated in 2019, 2018 and 2017 for impairment the aggregate carrying amount of long-term
investments for which the Company applies the cost method as a measurement alternative, as described in Note
2.25. No significant impairment charge was recorded on these investments in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The following table includes additional fair value information on financial assets and liabilities as at December
31, 2019 and 2018:

**2019** **2018**

**Carrying** **Estimated** **Carrying** **Estimated**

**Level** **Amount** **Fair Value** **Amount** **Fair Value**

**Cash equivalents [(1)]** **1** 1,691 1,691 2,138 2,138

**Long-term debt**

– Bank loans (including current portion) **2** 718 718 594 594

– Senior unsecured convertible bonds [(2)] **1** 1,354 2,103 1,316 1,501


(1) Cash equivalents primarily correspond to deposits at call with banks.

(2) The carrying amount of the senior unsecured convertible bonds as reported above corresponds to the
liability component only. For the convertible bonds issued on July 3, 2017 and outstanding as at
December 31, 2017, the carrying amount of the senior unsecured convertible bonds corresponds to the
liability component only, since, at initial recognition, an amount of $242 million was recorded directly in
shareholders’ equity as the value of the equity instrument embedded in the convertible instrument.

**Description** **Fair Values**

U.S. Treasury Bonds —

Total —

The methodologies used to estimate fair value are as follows:

**Debt securities classified as available-for-sale**

The fair value of these debt securities is estimated based upon quoted market prices for identical instruments.

**Foreign exchange forward contracts, currency options and collars**

The fair value of these instruments is estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments.

**Equity securities measured at fair value through earnings**

The fair value of these instruments is estimated based upon quoted market prices for identical instruments.

**Equity securities carried at cost as a measurement alternative**

The non-recurring fair value measurement is based on the valuation of the underlying investments on a new
round of third party financing or upon liquidation.

**Long-term debt and current portion of long-term debt**

The fair value of bank loans is determined by estimating future cash flows on a borrowing-by-borrowing basis
and discounting these future cash flows using the Company's incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowing arrangements.

The senior unsecured convertible bonds have been trading on the open market segment of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange since their issuance on July 3, 2017. The fair value of these instruments is the observable price of the
bonds on that market.

**Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, and accounts payable**

The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable estimates of fair value
due to the relatively short period of time between the origination of the instruments and their expected
realization.

**28. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**
