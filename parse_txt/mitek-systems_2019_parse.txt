**PART I**

**ITEM 1. BUSINESS.**

**Overview**

Mitek is a leading innovator of mobile image capture and digital identity verification solutions. We are a software development company with expertise in

computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We are currently serving more than 6,500 financial services organizations and leading marketplace
and financial technology (“fintech”) brands across the globe. Our solutions are embedded in native mobile apps and browsers to facilitate better online user
experiences, fraud detection and reduction, and compliant transactions.

Mitek’s Mobile Deposit® solution is used today by millions of consumers in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada for mobile check deposit. Mobile

Deposit® enables individuals and businesses to remotely deposit checks using their camera-equipped smartphone or tablet. Our Mobile Deposit® solution is
embedded within the financial institutions’ digital banking apps used by consumers and has now processed over three billion check deposits. Mitek began selling
Mobile Deposit® in early 2008 and received its first patent issued for this product in August 2010.

Mitek’s Mobile Verify® verifies a user’s identity online enabling organizations to build safer digital communities. Scanning an identity document helps

enable an enterprise to verify the identity of the person with whom they are conducting business, comply with growing governmental Anti-Money Laundering
(“AML”) and Know Your Customer (“KYC”) regulatory requirements, and to improve the overall customer experience for digital onboarding. To be sure the
person submitting the identity document is who they say they are, Mitek’s Mobile Verify Face Comparison provides an additional layer of online verification and
compares the face on the submitted identity document with the live selfie photo of the user.

The combination of identity document capture and data extraction process enables the organization to prefill the end user’s application, with far fewer key

strokes, thus reducing keying errors, and improving both operational efficiency and the customer experience. Today, the financial services verticals (banks, credit
unions, lenders, payments processors, card issuers, fintech companies, etc.) represent the greatest percentage of use of our solutions, but there is accelerated
adoption by marketplaces, sharing economy, and hospitality sectors. Mitek uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to constantly improve the product
performance of Mobile Verify® such as speed and accuracy of approvals of identification documents. The core of our user experience is driven by Mitek
MiSnap™, the leading image capture technology, which is incorporated across our product lines. It provides a simple, intuitive, and superior user-experience,
making digital transactions faster, more accurate, and easier for the consumer. Mobile Fill® automates application prefill of any form with user data by simply
snapping a picture of the driver’s license or other similar user identity document.

CheckReader™ enables financial institutions to automatically extract data from a check image received across any deposit channel – branch, ATM, RDC,

and mobile. Through the automatic recognition of all fields on checks, whether handwritten or machine print, CheckReader™ speeds the time to deposit for banks
and customers and helps enable financial institutions to comply with check clearing regulations.

We market and sell our products and services worldwide through internal, direct sales teams located in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America as well as

through channel partners. Our partner sales strategy includes channel partners who are financial services technology providers and identity verification providers.
These partners integrate our products into their solutions to meet the needs of their customers.

**Product and Technology Overview**

**_Technology_**

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we had one operating segment: the development, sale, and service of our proprietary software solutions

related to mobile image capture and identity verification.

Our digital technology solutions are provided in two parts: (i) a software development kit (“SDK”) for mobile image capture and (ii) a software platform

which utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to classify and extract data to enable mobile check deposit as well as aid the authentication of identity
documents including passports, identity cards, and driver's licenses using a camera-equipped device.

Our technology utilizes patented algorithms that analyze images of identity documents in many ways. These include image quality analysis, image repair

and optimization, document identification and classification, data extraction, and authenticators.

**_Products_**

_Mobile Deposit®_

Mitek invented Mobile Deposit® to allow individuals and businesses to remotely deposit checks using their camera-equipped smartphone or tablet.

Mobile Deposit® is utilized by the mobile banking apps of retail banks. As of September 30, 2019, more than 6,500 U.S. financial institutions had signed

agreements to deploy Mobile Deposit®.

The Mobile Deposit® process allows consumers to take photographs of the front and back of a check and then remotely deposit the check with their

participating bank by submitting the images electronically. Mitek delivers a simple and easy user experience with our proprietary mobile automatic capture which
assists users in capturing a usable image of a check by holding their mobile device over the check. We began selling Mobile Deposit® in early 2008.

_Mobile Verify®_

Mobile Verify® is an identity verification solution that can be integrated into mobile apps, mobile websites, and desktop applications. Mobile Verify®

combines an optimal image capture experience with our leading document authentication technology — assisting our customers validate that the identity
document presented in a digital transaction is genuine and unaltered. Adding a second layer for identity proofing, Mobile Verify® ties the portrait extracted from
the identity document with a selfie of its presenter by doing a biometric face comparison.

The Mobile Verify® identity verification engine is a modular cross-platform architecture, which is built on machine learning and advanced computer vision

algorithms. In order to achieve the highest accuracy rates, Mitek’s technology was conceptualized to verify the authenticity of an identity document in the
following systematic approach:

-  Guided document capture, enabling users to take a quality photo for optimal processing;

-  Document classification computer vision algorithms recognize and classify thousands of diverse identity documents allowing for reliable data
extraction;

-  Data extraction that goes beyond traditional OCR to deconstruct the document and analyze the content of each field; and

-  Evaluation of authenticity elements, uses a combination of machine learning techniques and unique computer vision algorithms to help determine the
authenticity of a document by evaluating several elements within the document.

_Mobile Fill®_

Mobile Fill®, which includes automatic image capture, minimizes the numbers of clicks and expedites form fill completion. In mere seconds, and just by

taking a photo, prospects can complete application forms and quickly become approved users. Organizations can use Mobile Fill® for a variety of purposes,
including streamlining the process of opening a checking, savings, or credit card account, paying a bill, activating a ‘switch and save’ offer, and more. Mobile
Fill® is available for native apps and browser applications.

_Mobile Docs™_

Mobile Docs™ is a mobile document scanning solution. It enables consumers to take photos of documents resulting in scanner-quality images. Mobile

Docs™ is used to submit the trailing documents required for digital account opening, lending, and other use cases where supporting documentation is required in a
workflow.

_CheckReader™_

CheckReader™ enables financial institutions to automatically extract data from checks once they have been scanned or photographed by the application.

Easily integrated into mobile and server-based applications providing automatic image pre-processing and recognition capabilities, CheckReader™ allows for the
automatic recognition of all fields on checks and generic payments documents, whether handwritten or machine print. CheckReader™ is utilized as a core
component throughout a wide range of check processing applications; including ATMs, centralized and back office processes, remittance, merchants, and fraud
applications. CheckReader™ is deployed within eight of the top ten U.S.-based banks, 90% of French and Brazilian Banks, and 100% of United Kingdom banks.

_XE™_

XE™ is powered by a recurrent neural network engine and delivers significantly higher levels of accuracy for check image processing. The technology is

designed to locate and extract key fields on checks such as the amount (Courtesy Amount and Legal Amount), date, and payee name, regardless of whether the
data is handwritten, machine print, or cursive handwriting. With built-in image quality analysis and image usability analysis, the toolkit also ensures that the check
meets the Check Clearing for the 21[st] Century Act requirements and other industry and regulatory standards.


-----

_ID_CLOUD™_

ID_CLOUD™ is a fully automated identity verification solution that can be integrated into a customers’ application to instantly read and validate identity

documents. ID_CLOUD™ automated technology enables global enterprises to improve their customer acquisition technology while meeting AML requirements in
a safe and cost-effective manner. This solution is available in the cloud, via mobile websites, and desktop applications. Additionally, a version of ID_CLOUD™ is
available that works locally on a desktop which is connected to a propriety hardware scanner for reading and validating identity documents.

**Sales and Marketing**

We derive revenue predominately from the sale of licenses (to both our on premise and transactional software as a service (“SaaS”) products) and

transaction fees to use our Mobile Deposit®, Mobile Verify®, Mobile Fill®, Mobile Docs™, CheckReader™, and ID_CLOUD™ products, and to a lesser extent
by providing maintenance and professional services for the products we offer. The revenue we derive from the sale of such licenses is derived from both the sale to
our channel partners of licenses to sell the applications we offer as well as the direct sale of licenses and services to customers.

We have an internal marketing group that develops corporate and digital marketing strategies. The internal team executes these strategies with the help of

external resources as needed to support both direct sales and channel partners’ sales efforts.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we derived revenue of $22.8 million from two customers, with such customers accounting for 17% and 10%,

respectively, of our total revenue. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we derived revenue of $20.0 million from two customers, with such customers
accounting for 22% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we derived revenue of $10.4 million from one
customer, with such customer accounting for 23% of the Company’s total revenue.

Deposits revenue accounted for approximately 67%, 65%, and 71% of the Company’s total revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018,

and 2017, respectively. Identity verification revenue accounted for approximately 33%, 35%, and 29% of the Company’s total revenue for the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Revenue from international sales accounted for approximately 31%, 27%, and 14% of the Company’s total
revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

**Intellectual Property**

Our success depends in large part upon our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through a combination of

patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third party non-disclosure agreements, and other measures. We believe that factors such as the
technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product development, frequent product enhancements, name recognition, and reliable product maintenance
are essential to establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in
the U.S. or abroad will be adequate. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which
afford only limited protection. Further, there can be no assurance that our patents will offer any protection or that they will not be challenged, invalidated, or
circumvented. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of a third party, our operating results could be
adversely affected.

As of September 30, 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued us 57 patents and we have filed for 25 additional domestic and international

patents. We have 38 registered trademarks and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks, as appropriate. We claim common law protection
for, and may seek to register, other trademarks. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees.

**Market Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks**

We believe that financial institutions, fintechs, and other companies see our patented solutions as a way to provide a superior digital customer experience to

meet growing consumers demands of trust and convenience online and, at the same time, assist them in meeting regulatory requirements. The value of digital
transformation to our customers is a possible increase in top line revenue and a reduction in the cost of sales and service. As the use of new technology increases,
so does associated fraud and cyber-attacks. The negative outcomes of fraud and cyber-attacks encompass financial losses, brand damage, and loss of loyal
customers. We predict growth in both our deposits and identity verification products based on current trends in payments, online lending, more stringent
regulations, growing usage of sharing apps and online marketplaces, and the ever-increasing demand for digital services.

Factors adversely affecting the pricing of, or demand for, our digital solutions, such as competition from other products or technologies, any decline in the

demand for digital transactions, or negative publicity or obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate, could result in lower revenues or
gross margins. Further, because substantially all of our revenues are from a few types of technology, our product concentration may make us especially vulnerable
to market demand and competition from other technologies, which could reduce our revenues.


-----

The sales cycle for our software and services can be lengthy and the implementation cycles for our software and services by our channel partners and

customers can also be lengthy, often as long as six months and sometimes longer for larger customers. If implementation of our products by our channel partners
and customers is delayed or otherwise not completed, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Revenues related to most of our on-premise licenses for mobile products are required to be recognized up front upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue

recognition criteria. Revenue related to our SaaS products is recognized ratably over the life of the contract or as transactions are used depending on the contract
criteria. The recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the term of our license
agreements, the timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers, and the timing of any re-orders of additional licenses and/or
license renewals by our channel partners and customers.

During each of the last few years, sales of licenses to one or more channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue each year. This is

attributable to the timing of renewals or purchases of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any single channel partner. If we were to lose a channel
partner relationship, we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell our products to the
end-users that had purchased products from the channel partner we lost. However, in that case, we or another channel partner must establish a relationship with the
end-users, which could take time to develop, if it develops at all.

We have a growing number of competitors in the mobile image capture and identity verification industry, many of which have greater financial, technical,

marketing, and other resources. However, we believe our patented mobile image capture and identity verification technology, our growing portfolio of products
and geographic coverage for the financial services industry, and our market expertise gives us a distinct competitive advantage. To remain competitive, we must
continue to offer products that are attractive to the consumer as well as being secure, accurate, and convenient. To help us remain competitive, we intend to further
strengthen performance of our portfolio of products through research and development as well as partnering with other technology providers.

**Competition**

The market for our products and solutions is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and

other market activities of industry participants. We face direct and indirect competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of products and
solutions to our current and potential customers. Our principal competition comes from: (i) customer-developed solutions; (ii) companies offering alternative
methods of identity verification; and (iii) companies offering competing technologies capable of mobile remote deposit capture or authenticating identity
documents and facial photo comparison.

It is also possible that we will face competition from new industry participants or alternative technologies. Moreover, as the market for automated document

processing, image recognition and authentication, check imaging, and fraud detection software develops, a number of companies with significantly greater
resources than we have could attempt to enter or increase their presence in our industry, either independently or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our
competitors, or otherwise increase their focus on the industry. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative
relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our current and potential customers.

Our products are compliant with Service-Oriented Architecture standards and compete, to various degrees, with products produced by a number of

substantial competitors. Competition among product providers in this market generally focuses on price, accuracy, reliability, global coverage, and technical
support. We believe our primary competitive advantages in this market are: (i) our mobile auto image capture user experience used by millions of consumers; (ii)
our patented science; (iii) scalability; and (iv) an architectural software design that allows our products to be more readily modified, improved with added
functionality, and configured for new products, thereby allowing our software to be easily upgraded.

Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on

our business, operating results, and financial condition.

**Research and Development**

We develop software products internally and also purchase or license rights to third-party intellectual property. We believe that our future success depends

in part on our ability to maintain and improve our core technologies, enhance our existing products, and develop new products that meet an expanding range of
customer requirements.

Internal research and development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products and gives us the ability to determine which modifications

and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented to ensure the proper functioning and improved performance of our products. We
intend to expand our existing product offerings and introduce new mobile image capture and digital identity verification capabilities that meet a broader set of
needs of our customers. We intend to continue to support the major industry standard operating environments.

Our research and development organization includes software engineers and scientists, many of whom have advanced degrees, as well as additional

personnel in quality assurance and related disciplines. All our scientists and software engineers are involved in product development.

The development team includes specialists in artificial intelligence, computer vision, software engineering, user interface design, product documentation,

and quality assurance. The team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the performance, quality, and utility of all of our products. In addition to research
and development, our engineering staff provides customer technical support on an as-needed basis.

Our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $19.0 million, $15.7 million, and $10.4

million, respectively. We expect research and development expenses during fiscal year 2020 to increase as compared with those incurred in fiscal year 2019 as we
continue our new product research and development efforts.

**Employees and Labor Relations**

As of September 30, 2019, we had 284 employees, 133 in the U.S. and 151 internationally, 272 of which are full time. Our total employee base consists of

146 sales and marketing, professional services, and document review employees, 92 research and development and support employees, and 46 employees in
executive, finance, network administration, and other capacities. In addition, we engaged various consultants in the areas of research and development, product
development, finance, and marketing during fiscal year 2019. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor
organization. Substantially all of our employees, other than certain number of our executive officers and employees with customary employment arrangements
within Europe, are at will employees, which means that each employee can terminate his or her relationship with us and we can terminate our relationship with him
or her at any time. We offer industry competitive wages and benefits and are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee
productivity and satisfaction. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

**ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.**

_The following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below_

_are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business_
_operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, projected results, and future prospects_
_could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your_
_investment or interest._

**Risks Associated With Our Business and Operations**

**_We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from a few types of technologies. If these technologies and the related products do not achieve or continue_**
**_to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected._**

We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from license sales and services provided with our software products to customers incorporating our

intelligent mobile imaging technology and software products. If we are unable to achieve or continue to achieve market acceptance of our core technologies or
products incorporating such technologies, we will not generate significant revenue growth from the sale of our products.

Additionally, factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for our products and services, such as competition from other products or technologies,

any decline in the demand for mobile image processing, negative publicity, or obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We cannot predict the impact that the decline of the use of checks, changes in consumer behavior facilitated by advances in technologies, and the development_**
**_of check alternatives, or the plateau of the penetration of active mobile banking users may have on our business._**

Over the last few years, the use of checks has started to decline. Advances in technologies have enabled the development of check alternatives like Zelle

and Venmo, which have caused certain changes in consumer behavior. As check alternatives become more widely accepted by consumers, the use of checks could
continue to decline, which could have a negative effect on our business. In addition, as the mobile banking market matures, the growth of active mobile banking
users is slowing, which may negatively impact our ability to grow our business.

**_Claims that our products infringe upon the rights, or have otherwise utilized proprietary information, of third parties may give rise to costly litigation against_**
**_us or our customers who we may be obligated to indemnify, and we could be prevented from selling those products, required to pay damages, and obligated to_**
**_defend against litigation or indemnify our customers._**

In the past, third parties have brought claims against us and against our customers who use our products asserting that certain technologies incorporated into

our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. Although we have resolved past claims against us that we have infringed on third party patents, there can
be no assurance that we will not receive additional claims against us asserting that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that
our products otherwise utilize such third parties’ proprietary information.

The Company is subject to indemnification demands related to various offers to license patents and allegations of patent infringement against several end
customers. Some of the offers and allegations have resulted in ongoing litigation. The Company is not a party to any such litigation. License offers to and
infringement allegations against the Company’s end-customers were made by Lighthouse Consulting Group, LLC; Lupercal, LLC; Pebble Tide, LLC; Dominion
Harbor Group, LLC; and IP Edge, LLC, which appear to be non-practicing entities (“NPEs”)—often called “patent trolls”—and not the Company’s competitors.
These NPEs may seek to exact settlements from our end-customers, resulting in new or renewed indemnification demands to the Company. At this time, the
Company does not believe it is obligated to indemnify any customers or end-customers resulting from license offers or patent infringement allegations by the
companies listed above. However, the Company could incur substantial costs if it is determined that it is required to indemnify any customers or end-customers in
connection with these offers or allegations. Given the potential for impact to other customers and the industry, the Company is actively monitoring the offers,
allegations and any resulting litigation.

On July 7, 2018, United Services Automobile Association (“USAA”) filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) in the Eastern District

of Texas alleging that Wells Fargo’s remote deposit capture systems (which in part utilize technology provided by us to Wells Fargo through a partner), infringe
four USAA owned patents related to mobile deposits (the “First Wells Lawsuit”). On August 17, 2018, USAA filed a second lawsuit (the “Second Wells Lawsuit”
and together with the First Wells Lawsuit, the “Wells Lawsuits”) against Wells Fargo in the Eastern District of Texas asserting that an additional five patents
owned by USAA were infringed by Wells Fargo’s remote deposit capture system. Subsequently, on November 6, 2019, a jury in the First Wells Lawsuit found
that Wells Fargo willfully infringed at least one of the Subject Patents (as defined below) and awarded USAA $200 million in damages. The jury verdict is subject
to post-trial motions and appeal by Wells Fargo. The Second Wells Lawsuit is ongoing


-----

and no final judgments or awards have been made to date. Given the potential impact such litigation could have on the use of our products by Wells Fargo, our
other customers, as well as the industry as a whole, we are closely monitoring the Wells Lawsuits.

While the Wells Lawsuits do not name us as a defendant, given the Company’s prior history of litigation with USAA and the continued use of our products

by our customers, on November 1, 2019, we filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking declaratory judgment (the
“DJ Action”) that our products do not infringe USAA’s U.S. Patent Nos. 8,699,779; 9,336,517; 9,818,090; and 8,977,571 (collectively, the “Subject Patents”). We
intend to vigorously defend our right to utilize our products free and clear of the Subject Patents. However, this litigation is at an early stage and the outcome is
uncertain. USAA has not filed a response to the DJ Action or otherwise made any claims directly against the Company, but could do so in the future or otherwise
proceed to file a claim for patent infringement. If such a claim were brought and the court ruled in favor of USAA, we could be enjoined from utilizing certain of
our products, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, prospects, and results of operations.

If our technology or products are found to infringe upon or otherwise utilize the intellectual property rights of third parties, including USAA, we could incur

substantial costs as we may have to:

-  obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors
access to the same intellectual property licensed to us;

-  expend significant resources to redesign our products or technology to avoid infringement;

-  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products;

-  pay substantial damages;

-  incur substantial costs indemnifying our customers; or

-  defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we are successful or not, and which could result in a substantial diversion
of our management resources and limit our exclusive rights to the technology we have developed.

Furthermore, in addition to the DJ Action, we may initiate other claims or litigation against parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to

establish the validity of our intellectual property rights. Litigation, either as plaintiff or defendant, could result in significant expense to us, whether or not such
litigation is resolved in our favor. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management
and key personnel from our business operations.

**_If the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our_**
**_competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably._**

Our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products, including Mobile Deposit®. We rely on

trademark, trade secret, copyright, and patent law, as well as a combination of non-disclosure, confidentiality, and other contractual arrangements to protect our
technology and rights. However, these legal protections afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain
any competitive advantage.

In addition, we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office

(“PTO”) may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications, and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications, if
any, may not provide us with significant commercial protection or may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. We could also incur substantial costs in
proceedings before the PTO. Our issued and licensed patents and those that may be issued or licensed in the future may expire or may be challenged, invalidated,
or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing technologies related to ours. Additionally, upon expiration of our issued or
licensed patents, we may lose some of our rights to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired
patents.

We also must rely on contractual provisions with the third parties that license technology to us and that obligate these third parties to protect our rights in the

technology licensed to us. There is no guarantee that these third parties would be successful in attempting to protect our rights in any such licensed technology.
There is no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around our patents or other intellectual property or any intellectual property or technology
licensed to us.

We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary

technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary
technology. We seek to protect our know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment
agreements with our employees, consultants, partners, and customers. However, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful
protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors
discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information.


-----

In addition, we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products. Common law trademarks

provide less protection than registered trademarks. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If we cannot adequately

protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect
our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We face competition from several companies that may have greater resources than we do, which could result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of_**
**_market share._**

We compete against numerous companies in the mobile imaging software market. Competition in this market may increase as a result of a number of

factors, such as the entrance of new or larger competitors or alternative technologies. These competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and
public relations resources, larger client bases, and greater brand or name recognition. These competitors could, among other things:

-  announce new products or technologies that have the potential to replace our existing product offerings;

-  force us to charge lower prices; or

-  adversely affect our relationships with current clients.

We may be unable to compete successfully against our current and potential competitors and if we lose business to our competitors or are forced to lower

our prices, our revenue, operating margins, and market share could decline.

**_We must continue to engage in extensive research and development in order to remain competitive._**

Our ability to compete effectively with our mobile imaging software products depends upon our ability to meet changing market conditions and develop

enhancements to our products on a timely basis in order to maintain our competitive advantage. The markets for products incorporating mobile imaging software
technology and products are characterized by rapid advancements in technology and changes in user preferences. Our continued growth will ultimately depend
upon our ability to develop additional technologies and attract strategic alliances for related or separate products. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in developing and marketing product enhancements and additional technologies, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the
successful development, introduction and marketing of these products, or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements
of the marketplace, will be of acceptable quality, or will achieve market acceptance.

**_Defects or malfunctions in our products could hurt our reputation, sales and profitability._**

Our business and the level of customer acceptance of our products depend upon the continuous, effective, and reliable operation of our products. Our

products are extremely complex and are continually being modified and improved, and as such may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or
as new versions are released. To the extent that defects or errors cause our products to malfunction and our customers’ use of our products is interrupted, our
reputation could suffer and our revenue could decline or be delayed while such defects are remedied. We may also be subject to liability for the defects and
malfunctions of third party technology partners and others with whom our products and services are integrated. In addition, our products are typically intended for
use in applications that are critical to a customer’s business. As a result, we believe that our customers and potential customers have a greater sensitivity to product
defects than the market for software products in general. There can be no assurance that, despite our testing, errors will not be found in new products or releases
after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our
reputation, adverse litigation, or increased service and warranty costs, any of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and
financial condition.

**_Our historical order flow patterns, which we expect to continue, have caused forecasting difficulties for us. If we do not meet our forecasts or analysts’_**
**_forecasts for us, the price of our common stock may decline._**

Historically, a significant portion of our sales have resulted from shipments during the last few weeks of the quarter from orders received in the final month

of the applicable quarter. We do, however, base our expense levels, in significant part, on our expectations of future revenue. As a result, we expect our expense
levels to be relatively fixed in the short term. Any concentration of sales at the end of the quarter may limit our ability to plan or adjust operating expenses.
Therefore, if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur or are delayed, expenditure levels could be disproportionately high as a percentage of sales, and our
operating results for that quarter would be adversely affected. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not and will
not necessarily be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. If our operating results for a quarter are below the
expectations of public market analysts and investors, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.


-----

**_Entry into new lines of business, and our offering of new products and services, resulting from our acquisitions may result in exposure to new risks._**

New lines of business, products or services could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls and could reduce our

revenues and potentially generate losses. New products and services, or entrance into new markets, may require substantial time, resources and capital, and
profitability targets may not be achieved. Entry into new markets entails inherent risks associated with our inexperience, which may result in costly decisions that
could harm our profit and operating results. There are material inherent risks and uncertainties associated with offering new products, and services, especially
when new markets are not fully developed or when the laws and regulations regarding a new product are not mature. Factors outside of our control, such as
developing laws and regulations, regulatory orders, competitive product offerings and changes in commercial and consumer demand for products or services may
also materially impact the successful implementation of new products or services. Failure to manage these risks, or failure of any product or service offerings to be
successful and profitable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Adverse economic conditions or reduced spending on information technology solutions may adversely impact our revenue and profitability._**

Unpredictable and unstable changes in economic conditions, including a recession, inflation, increased government intervention, or other changes, may

adversely affect our general business strategy. In particular an economic downturn affecting small and medium sized businesses could significantly affect our
business as many of our existing and target customers are in the small and medium sized business sector and these businesses are more likely to be significantly
affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. Additionally, these customers often have limited discretionary funds, which they may
choose to spend on items other than our products and services, causing our revenue to decline.

**_We may need to raise additional capital to fund continuing operations and an inability to raise the necessary capital or the inability to do so on acceptable_**
**_terms could threaten the success of our business._**

We currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital

expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, such resources may not be sufficient to fund the long-term growth of our business. If we
determine that it is necessary to raise additional funds, we may choose to do so through public or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit, strategic
collaborations, licensing, or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all.
Furthermore, any additional equity or equity-related financing may be dilutive to our stockholders, new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of existing holders of our shares of common stock, and debt or equity financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant
interest costs. If we obtain funding through a strategic collaboration or licensing arrangement, we may be required to relinquish our rights to certain of our
technologies, products or marketing territories. If we are unable to obtain the financing necessary to support our operations, we may be required to defer, reduce or
eliminate certain planned expenditures or significantly curtail our operations.

**_We expect to incur additional expenses related to the integration of ICAR Vision Systems, S.L. and A2iA Group II, S.A.S._**

We expect to incur additional expenses in connection with the integration of the business, policies, procedures, operations, technologies, and systems of

ICAR Vision Systems, S.L., a company incorporated under the laws of Spain (“ICAR”), and A2iA Group II, S.A.S., a simplified joint stock company formed
under the laws of France (“A2iA”). There are a large number of systems and functions that are being integrated into our larger organization, including, but not
limited to, management information, accounting and finance, billing, payroll and benefits, and regulatory compliance. In addition, acquisitions of foreign entities,
such as ICAR and A2iA, are particularly challenging because their prior practices may not meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SarbanesOxley”) and/or accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred to
integrate these businesses, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration
expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. During our fiscal year
ended September 30, 2019, we incurred $3.1 million in expenses in connection with our strategic restructuring of A2iA in June 2019, which consists of employee
severance obligations and other related costs.

**_We may be unable to successfully integrate our business with the respective businesses of ICAR and A2iA and realize the anticipated benefits of the_**
**_acquisitions._**

Our management will be required to continue to devote significant attention and resources to integrating our business practices and operations with that of

ICAR and A2iA. In particular, the acquisitions of ICAR and A2iA involve the combination of two companies that previously operated as independent companies
in different countries. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:


-----

-  complexities associated with managing our business and the respective businesses of ICAR and A2iA following the completion of the acquisition,
including the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks, and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that
minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies;

-  integrating the workforces of the companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality customer service; and

-  potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisitions, including costs to integrate the companies
that may exceed anticipated costs.

Any of the potential difficulties listed above could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees, and other

constituencies or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. For example,
subsequent to the acquisition of A2iA, we evaluated A2iA’s operations and determined that the market for certain products was small and lacking growth
opportunity, were not core to our strategy, and were not profitable for the Company. In order to streamline the organization and focus resources going forward, we
undertook a strategic restructuring of A2iA’s Paris operations in June 2019, which included, among other things, suspending the sale of certain A2iA products and
offerings and a reduction in workforce. While we expect meaningful financial benefits from our strategic restructuring plan, we may not be able to obtain the cost
savings and benefits that were initially anticipated.

**_Our actual financial and operating results following the acquisitions of ICAR and A2iA could differ materially from any expectations or guidance provided by_**
**_us concerning our future financial and operating results._**

The combined company resulting from the acquisitions of ICAR and A2iA may not perform as we or the market expects. Expectations regarding each of

ICAR’s and A2iA’s impact on our financial and operating results are subject to numerous assumptions, including assumptions derived from our diligence efforts
concerning the status of and prospects for the businesses of ICAR and A2iA, respectively, and assumptions relating to the near-term prospects for our industry
generally and the market for the products of ICAR and A2iA in particular. Additional assumptions that we have made relate to numerous matters, including,
without limitation, the following:

-  projections of future revenues;

-  anticipated financial performance of products and products currently in development;

-  our expected capital structure after the acquisitions, including after the distribution of any earnout-shares that may (under certain circumstances)
become payable to the former shareholders of ICAR;

-  our ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with the respective customers of ICAR and A2iA; and

-  other financial and strategic risks of the acquisitions.

We cannot provide any assurances with respect to the accuracy of our assumptions, including our assumptions with respect to future revenues or revenue

growth rates, if any, of ICAR or A2iA. Risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from currently anticipated results include, but
are not limited to, risks relating to our ability to realize incremental revenues from the acquisitions in the amounts that we currently anticipate; risks relating to the
willingness of customers and other partners of ICAR or A2iA to continue to conduct business with the combined company; and numerous risks and uncertainties
that affect our industry generally and the markets for our products and those of each of ICAR and A2iA. Any failure to realize the financial benefits we currently
anticipate from the acquisitions would have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition and could materially and adversely
affect the trading price or trading volume of our common stock.

**_Our corporate strategy and restructuring may not be successful._**

Subsequent to the acquisition of A2iA, we evaluated A2iA’s operations and determined that the market for certain products was small and lacking growth

opportunity, were not core to our strategy, and were not profitable for the Company. In order to streamline the organization and focus resources going forward, we
undertook a strategic restructuring of A2iA’s Paris operations in June 2019, which included, among other things, suspending the sale of certain A2iA products and
offerings and a reduction in workforce.

While we expect meaningful financial benefits from our strategic restructuring plan, we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were

anticipated when we decided to undertake the restructuring. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the
expected timeframe is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur,
our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.

**_Our annual and quarterly results have fluctuated greatly in the past and will likely continue to do so, which may cause substantial fluctuations in our common_**
**_stock price._**

Our annual and quarterly operating results have in the past and may in the future fluctuate significantly depending on factors including the timing of

customer projects and purchase orders, new product announcements and releases by us and other companies, gain or loss of significant customers, price
discounting of our products, the timing of expenditures, customer product delivery

requirements, the availability and cost of components or labor, and economic conditions, both generally and in the information technology market. Revenues
related to our licenses for mobile imaging software products are required to be recognized upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue recognition criteria. The
recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the terms of our license agreements, the
timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers and the timing of any re-orders of additional licenses and/or license renewals by
our channel partners and customers. Any unfavorable change in these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for a particular
quarter or year, which may cause downward pressure on our common stock price.

Historically, sales of licenses to our channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue. This is attributable to the timing of the purchase or

renewal of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any single channel partner. If we were to lose a channel partner relationship, we do not believe such a
loss would adversely affect our operations because either we or another channel partner could sell our products to the end-users that had purchased products from
the channel partner we lost. However, in that case, we or another channel partner must establish a relationship with the end-users, which could take time to
develop, if it develops at all.

We expect quarterly and annual fluctuations to continue for the foreseeable future. These fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations,

have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, or both.

**_We face risks related to the storage of our customers’ and their end users’ confidential and proprietary information. Our products may not provide absolute_**
**_security. We may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents._**

Our products are designed to maintain the confidentiality and security of our customers’ and their end users’ confidential and proprietary information that is

stored on our systems, which may include sensitive financial data and personally identifiable information about consumers. However, any accidental or willful
security breaches or other unauthorized access to this data could expose us to liability for the loss of such information, time-consuming and expensive litigation,
and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity.

We devote significant resources to addressing security vulnerabilities in our products, systems and processes, however our maintenance and regular

upgrades of our products, systems and processes, which are designed to protect the security of our products and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
information belonging to us and our clients, may not provide absolute security. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change
frequently, are increasingly sophisticated, and generally are difficult to recognize and react to. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement
adequate preventative or reactionary measures.

A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our products could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our

operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our clients, or damage to our systems or those of our clients and counterparties, and could
result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our clients, loss of confidence in our security measures, client dissatisfaction,
significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.

If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs, client perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in the

loss of clients. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection
technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants.

**_If we are unable to retain and recruit qualified personnel, or if any of our key executives or key employees discontinues his or her employment with us, it may_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business._**

We are highly dependent on the key members of our management team and other key technical personnel. If we were to lose the services of one or more of

our key personnel, or if we fail to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, it could materially and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, recruiting and
retaining qualified highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing development required to refine our technologies and introduce future products is critical to our
success. We may be unable to attract, assimilate, and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition within the high technology industry. We
do not have any employment agreements providing for a specific term of employment with any member of our senior management. We do not maintain “key man”
insurance policies on any of our officers or employees. We have granted and plan to grant restricted stock units or other forms of equity awards as a method of
attracting and retaining employees, motivating performance and aligning the interests of employees with those of our stockholders. As of September 30, 2019, we
had 807,144 shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future grants of equity awards under our existing equity compensation plans, which may
limit our ability to provide equity incentive awards to existing and future employees. If we are unable to adopt, implement and maintain equity compensation
arrangements that provide sufficient incentives, we may be unable to retain our existing employees and attract additional qualified candidates. If we are unable to
retain our existing employees, including qualified technical personnel, and attract additional qualified candidates, our business and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

**_Legislation and governmental regulations enacted in the U.S. and other countries that apply to us or to our customers may require us to change our current_**
**_products and services and/or result in additional expenses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

Legislation and governmental regulations including changes in legislation and governmental regulations impacting financial institutions, insurance

companies, and mobile device companies, affect how our business is conducted. Globally, legislation and governmental regulations also influence our current and
prospective customers’ activities, as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services. Compliance with these laws and regulations may
be onerous and expensive, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance. Any such increase in costs as a result
of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our
customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, cause us to change or limit our business practices or affect our financial condition and
operating results.

**_Due to our operations in non-U.S. markets, we are subject to certain risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition._**

We generate revenue in markets outside of the U.S. The risks inherent in global operations include:

-  lack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign laws and legal standards, including employment laws and privacy laws, which may vary
widely across the countries in which we sell our products;

-  increased expense to comply with U.S. laws that apply to foreign corporations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”);

-  compliance with, and potentially adverse tax consequences of, foreign tax regimes;

-  fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency exchange controls, price controls, and limitations on repatriation of earnings;

-  local economic conditions;

-  increased expense related to localization of products and development of foreign language marketing and sales materials;

-  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries;

-  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;

-  restrictive employment regulations;

-  difficulties and increased expense in implementing corporate policies and controls;

-  international intellectual property laws, which may be more restrictive or may offer lower levels of protection than U.S. law;

-  compliance with differing and changing local laws and regulations in multiple international locations, including regional data privacy laws, as well as
compliance with U.S. laws and regulations where applicable in these international locations; and

-  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.

If we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks associated with managing and expanding our international business, the risks could have a

material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Further, operating in international markets requires significant management
attention and financial resources. Due to the additional uncertainties and risks of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, international acquisitions tend to entail
risks and require additional oversight and management attention that are typically not attendant to acquisitions made within the U.S. We cannot be certain that the
investment and additional resources required to establish, acquire or integrate operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.

**_Our international operations may increase our exposure to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, tax, and other laws and regulations._**

The FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents. From

time to time, we may receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere about our business activities outside of the U.S. and our compliance with AntiCorruption Laws. While we have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, or
agents may violate our policies. Our acquisitions of ID Checker, ICAR, and A2iA may significantly increase our exposure to potential liability under AntiCorruption Laws. ID Checker, ICAR, and A2iA were not historically subject to the FCPA, Sarbanes-Oxley, or other laws, to which we are subject, and we may
become subject to liability if in the past, ID Checker’s, ICAR’s, and A2iA’s operations did not comply with such laws.

12


-----

Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees,

prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside of the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws,
policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment.

The European Union (“EU”) and the U.S. entered into a new framework (known as the “Privacy Shield”) in July 2016 to provide a mechanism for

companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. The Privacy Shield and other data transfer mechanisms are subject to legal challenge, which
generates uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers to the U.S. or interruption of such transfers. In the event a court blocks transfers to or from a particular
jurisdiction on the basis that transfer mechanisms are not legally adequate, this could cause operational interruptions, liabilities and reputational harm. These and
other requirements could increase the cost of compliance for us and our customers, restrict our and our customers’ ability to store and process data, negatively
impact our ability to offer our solutions in certain locations and limit our customers’ ability to deploy our solutions globally. These consequences may be more
significant in countries with legislation that requires data to remain localized “in country,” as this could require us or our customers to establish data storage in
other jurisdictions or apply local operational processes that are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes.

If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, thereby harming our

business. For example, in 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which establishes new requirements regarding the handling of
personal data and which became effective in May 2018. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.

Due to our international operations, we are subject to certain foreign tax regulations. Such regulations may not be clear, not consistently applied, and

subject to sudden change, particularly with regard to international transfer pricing. Our earnings could be reduced by the uncertain and changing nature of such tax
regulations.

**_Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations._**

Our business is generally conducted in U.S. dollars. However, we earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies

other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at
the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting
period. The costs of operating in The Netherlands, Spain, France, and other European markets are subject to the effects of exchange fluctuations of the Euro and
British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies will affect our net
revenues, net income (loss), and the value of balance sheet items denoted in foreign currencies, and can adversely affect our operating results.

**_Compliance with changing regulations concerning corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses._**

Our business is subject to laws, rules, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), Sarbanes-Oxley, and various other new regulations promulgated by the SEC and rules
promulgated by the national securities exchanges.

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, expands federal regulation of corporate governance matters and imposes requirements on publicly-held

companies, including us, to, among other things, provide stockholders with a periodic advisory vote on executive compensation and also adds compensation
committee reforms and enhanced pay-for-performance disclosures. While some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective upon enactment, and others have
been implemented upon the SEC’s adoption of related rules and regulations, the Dodd-Frank Act is not yet fully implemented and the scope and timing of the
adoption of additional rules and regulations thereunder is uncertain and accordingly, the cost of compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act is also uncertain. In addition,
Sarbanes-Oxley specifically requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure of controls and
procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report
on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), and our independent
registered public accounting firm is required to attest to our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent
registered public accounting firm may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our
compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. We currently have limited
internal audit capabilities and will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting
knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public
accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock
could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and
management resources.

These and other new or changed laws, rules, regulations and standards are, or will be, subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of

specificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by

13


-----

regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to
disclosure and governance practices. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and
administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Further, compliance with
new and existing laws, rules, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we
may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. Members of our board of directors (the “Board”) and our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a
result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and executive officers, which could harm our business. We continually evaluate and
monitor regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result.

**_We have a history of losses and we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future._**

Although we generated net income for the years ended September 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our operations resulted in a net loss of $0.7 million, $11.8

million, $5.3 million, and $7.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We may continue to incur significant losses
for the foreseeable future which may limit our ability to fund our operations and we may not generate income from operations in the future. As of September 30,
2019, September 30, 2018, and September 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $20.8 million, $21.0 million, and $17.5 million, respectively. Our future
profitability depends upon many factors, including several that are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:

-  changes in the demand for our products and services;

-  loss of key customers or contracts;

-  the introduction of competitive software;

-  the failure to gain market acceptance of our new and existing products;

-  the failure to successfully and cost effectively develop, introduce and market new products, services and product enhancements in a timely manner; and

-  the timing of recognition of revenue.

In addition, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses related to being a public company. As a result of these expenditures, we will have to

generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve and maintain future profitability.

**_An “ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, which could result in our payment of income_**
**_taxes earlier than if we were able to fully utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards._**

Federal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an “ownership

change” as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”). Generally, an “ownership change” occurs if the percentage
of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect “five percent shareholders” increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership
percentage at any time during an applicable testing period (typically, three years). Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” such
corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL and tax credit carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited.
While no “ownership change” has resulted in annual limitations, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an
“ownership change.” In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the consideration could result in an “ownership
change.” If an “ownership change” occurs in the future, utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could
potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. We have adopted a Section 382 Rights Agreement, discussed below, to protect our utilization of our NOL
and tax credit carryforwards.

**Risks Related to Investing in Our Common Stock**

**_From time-to-time our Board explores and considers strategic alternatives, including financings, strategic alliances, acquisitions, or the possible sale of the_**
**_Company. Our Board may not be able to identify or complete any suitable strategic alternatives, and announcements regarding any such strategic alternatives_**
**_could have an impact on our operations or stock price._**

In December 2018, after receiving unsolicited expressions of interest from multiple parties, we announced that we retained Evercore Group L.L.C. and Paul

Hastings LLP, our financial advisor and outside legal advisor, respectively, to assist the Board and our management team in exploring and reviewing strategic
alternatives. On May 1, 2019, we announced that we concluded this process. This process did not result in an offer to purchase the Company on terms and
conditions that were acceptable to the Board, given the Board’s view of the value of the Company and its assets and the Board’s belief that we, can ultimately
create more value for our stockholders by continuing to execute our current business strategy.

Our announcement on May 1, 2019 and other announcements related to strategic alternatives may result in a perception that there is uncertainty about the

future of our business and operations, regardless of the actual circumstances. Such perceptions may

14


-----

negatively affect our business, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board, management, and employees, all of which could materially and
adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, our stock price may experience periods of increased volatility as a result of such perceptions and
speculation about the future of our business and operations.

While we have concluded the process started in December 2018, it is possible that a strategic transaction may arise in the future. We currently have no

agreements or commitments to engage in any specific strategic transactions, and we cannot assure you that any future explorations of various strategic alternatives
will result in any specific action or transaction. If we determine to engage in a strategic transaction, we cannot predict the impact that such strategic transaction
might have on our operations or stock price. We do not intend to provide updates or make further comments regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives,
unless otherwise required by law.

**_Concentration of ownership among our current and former directors and executive officers may limit our other stockholder’s ability to influence significant_**
**_corporate decisions._**

As noted in our 2019 annual proxy statement, filed January 28, 2019 our current and former directors and executive officers as a group beneficially owned

approximately 8.2% of our outstanding common stock. Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Delaware General Corporation Law
(the “DGCL”), these stockholders may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have some control over our management and policies. Some of these persons may have interests that are
different from yours. For example, these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree. The concentration of ownership could
delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn
could reduce the price of our stock. In addition, these stockholders could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office,
delay or prevent changes in control of the Company, or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as
amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions.

**_Future sales of our common stock by our insiders may cause our stock price to decline._**

A significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by our current and former directors and executive officers. Resales of a substantial number of shares

of our stock by these stockholders, announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock, or the perception that substantial resales may be
made by such stockholders could adversely impact the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have in the past and may in the
future enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they may sell shares of our stock from time to time in the future. Actual or potential sales by these
individuals, including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, regardless of the actual circumstances, could be interpreted by the market as an
indication that the insider has lost confidence in our stock and adversely impact the market price of our stock.

We have registered and expect to continue to register shares reserved under our equity plans under a registration statement on Form S-8. All shares issued

pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-8 can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions on our affiliates under Rule 144 of
the Securities Act. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could adversely impact the trading price of our stock.

**_Future sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline._**

We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for sale will have on

the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time. We currently have an effective universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC,
providing for the potential issuance of shares of our common stock and other securities. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other
securities in the public market, or the perception that those sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, any such
decline may make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock at prices you may deem acceptable.

**_A potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could result in potential operational disruption, divert our resources, and could_**
**_potentially result in adverse consequences under certain of our agreements._**

Our investors may launch a proxy contest to nominate director candidates for election to the Board at our annual meeting of stockholders. A proxy contest

would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and could result in potential operational disruption, including that the investornominated directors (if elected) may have a business agenda for the Company that is different than the strategic and operational plans of the existing Board, which
agenda may adversely affect our stockholders. Further, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control could result in the loss of potential
business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our
business and operating results and create increased volatility in our stock price.

Further, a change in a majority of the Board may, under certain circumstances, result in a change of control under certain employment agreements we have

with our executive management and our 2002 Stock Option Plan, 2006 Stock Option Plan, 2010 Stock Option Plan, Amended and Restated 2012 Incentive Plan,
Director Restricted Stock Unit Plan, and any equity based awards

15


-----

issued thereunder. Pursuant to the agreements and awards, certain payments and vesting provisions may be triggered following a change of control, conditioned
upon a qualifying termination that occurs within 12 months of any such change of control.

**_Our corporate documents and the DGCL contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent attempts to_**
**_replace or remove current management, and reduce the market price of our stock._**

Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition

involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue up to one million
shares of “blank check” preferred stock, sixty thousand of which are reserved in connection with the Section 382 Rights Agreement, discussed below. As a result,
without further stockholder approval, the Board has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these
rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. We are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the DGCL. Under
these provisions, if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder,” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special
approval, which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us. An “interested stockholder” is,
generally, a stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours who has owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting
stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in the DGCL.

**_Our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws provide for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and_**
**_limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our stockholders because corporate resources may be expended for the_**
**_benefit of officers and/or directors._**

Pursuant to our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws and as authorized under applicable Delaware law, our directors

and officers are not liable for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duties, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the
Company or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) under Section
174 of the DGCL; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

We have entered into a separate indemnification agreement (the “Indemnification Agreement”) with each of our directors. Under the Indemnification

Agreement, each director is entitled to be indemnified against all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by or on behalf of such director in connection with any claims, proceedings or other actions brought against such director as a result of the director’s
service to us, provided that the director: (i) acted in good faith; (ii) reasonably believed the action was in our best interest; and (iii) in criminal proceedings,
reasonably believed the conduct was not unlawful. Additionally, the Indemnification Agreement entitles each director to contribution of expenses from us in any
proceeding in which we are jointly liable with such director, but for which indemnification is not otherwise available. The Indemnification Agreement also entitles
each director to advancement of expenses incurred by such director in connection with any claim, proceeding or other action in advance of the final adjudication of
any such claim, proceeding or other action, provided the director agrees to reimburse us for all such advances if it shall ultimately be determined that the director is
not entitled to indemnification.

The foregoing limitations of liability and provisions for expenses may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our stockholders because

corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers and/or directors.

**_The Company has entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, and if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to such agreement are exercised, it could_**
**_materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock._**

We entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement on October 23, 2018, with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., a federally chartered trust company, as

Rights Agent (the “Rights Agreement”). The Rights Agreement is intended to discourage acquisitions of our common stock which could result in a cumulative
“ownership change” as defined under Section 382, thereby preserving our current ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax
obligations, which would become subject to limitations if we were to experience an “ownership change,” as defined under Section 382. While this Rights
Agreement is intended to preserve our current ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from
accumulating more than 4.9% of our common stock, which could delay or discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders may consider favorable. In addition,
if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which could materially
and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Moreover, sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issued upon such exercise, or
the perception that such sales may occur, could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These issuances would also cause our per share net
income, if any, to decrease in future periods.

**_The market price of our common stock has been volatile and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value._**

The market price of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. For example, during the three year period ended

September 30, 2019, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $5.45 to $12.53. In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced
significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies and that have often been
unrelated to the operating performance of particular

16


-----

companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the
price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors.

Some specific factors, in addition to the other risk factors identified above, that may have a significant effect on the price of our stock, many of which we

cannot control, include but are not limited to:

-  our announcements or our competitors’ announcements of technological innovations;

-  quarterly variations in operating results;

-  changes in our product pricing policies or those of our competitors;

-  claims of infringement of intellectual property rights or other litigation;

-  the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;

-  changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;

-  changes in our growth rate or our competitors’ growth rates;

-  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;

-  our inability to raise additional capital as needed;

-  changes in financial markets or general economic conditions;

-  sales of stock by us or members of our management team or Board; and

-  changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.

**_Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends, our stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if our stock price appreciates in_**
**_value._**

We have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and

expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will
depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which
it was purchased.

**ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.**

None.

**ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.**

Our principal executive offices, as well as our research and development facility, are located in approximately 29,000 square feet of office space in San

Diego, California and the term of the lease continues through June 30, 2024. The average annual base rent under this lease is approximately $1.0 million per year.
In connection with this lease, we received tenant improvement allowances totaling approximately $1.0 million. These lease incentives are being amortized as a
reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease.

Our other offices are located in Paris, France; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; New York, New York; Barcelona, Spain; and London, United Kingdom. The

term of the Paris, France lease continues through July 31, 2021, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.4 million (or $0.4 million). The term of the
Amsterdam, The Netherlands lease continues through December 31, 2022, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.2 million (or $0.2 million). The term of
the New York, New York lease continues through November 30, 2024, with an annual base rent of approximately $0.2 million. The term of the Barcelona, Spain
lease continues through May 31, 2023, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.1 million (or $0.1 million). The term of the London, United Kingdom lease
continues through May 31, 2020, with an annual base rent of approximately £63,000 (or approximately $78,000).

Other than the lease for our office space in San Diego, California, we do not believe that the leases for our offices are material

to the Company. We believe our existing properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of our business.

**ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.**

_Claim Against ICAR_

On June 11, 2018, a claim was filed before the Juzgado de Primera Instancia number 5 of Barcelona, Spain, the first instance court in the Spanish civil

procedure system, against ICAR. The claim, also directed to Mr. Xavier Codó Grasa, former controlling shareholder of ICAR and its current General Manager,
was brought by the Spanish company Global Equity & Corporate Consulting, S.L. for the alleged breach by ICAR of a services agreement entered into in the
context of the sale of the shares in ICAR to Mitek Holding B.V.

ICAR responded to the claim on September 7, 2018 and the court process is ongoing.

The amount claimed is €0.8 million (or $0.9 million), plus the interest accrued during the court proceedings.

Pursuant and subject to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement concerning the acquisition of the shares in ICAR, Mitek Holding B.V. is to be

indemnified in respect of any damages suffered by ICAR and/or Mitek Holding B.V. in respect of this claim.

_Third Party Claims Against Our Customers_

The Company is subject to indemnification demands related to various offers to license patents and allegations of patent infringement against several end
customers. Some of the offers and allegations have resulted in ongoing litigation. The Company is not a party to any such litigation. License offers to and
infringement allegations against the Company’s end-customers were made by Lighthouse Consulting Group, LLC; Lupercal, LLC; Pebble Tide, LLC; Dominion
Harbor Group, LLC; and IP Edge, LLC, which appear to be non-practicing entities (“NPEs”)—often called “patent trolls”—and not the Company’s competitors.
These NPEs may seek to exact settlements from our end-customers, resulting in new or renewed indemnification demands to the Company. At this time, the
Company does not believe it is obligated to indemnify any customers or end-customers resulting from license offers or patent infringement allegations by the
companies listed above. However, the Company could incur substantial costs if it is determined that it is required to indemnify any customers or end-customers in
connection with these offers or allegations. Given the potential for impact to other customers and the industry, the Company is actively monitoring the offers,
allegations and any resulting litigation.

On July 7, 2018, USAA filed the First Wells Lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Wells Fargo’s remote deposit capture systems (which in

part utilize technology provided by the Company to Wells Fargo through a partner) infringe four USAA owned patents related to mobile deposits. On August 17,
2018, USAA filed the Second Wells Lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas asserting that an additional five patents owned by USAA were infringed by Wells
Fargo’s remote deposit capture system. Subsequently, on November 6, 2019, a jury in the First Wells Lawsuit found that Wells Fargo willfully infringed at least
one of the Subject Patents and awarded USAA $200 million in damages. The jury verdict is subject to post-trial motions and appeal by Wells Fargo. The Second
Wells Lawsuit is ongoing and no final judgments or awards have been made to date. Given the potential impact such litigation could have on the use of Mitek’s
products by Wells Fargo, our other customers, as well as the industry as a whole, the Company is closely monitoring the Wells Lawsuits.

While the Wells Lawsuits do not name Mitek as a defendant, given the Company’s prior history of litigation with USAA and the continued use of Mitek’s

products by its customers, on November 1, 2019, the Company filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking
declaratory judgment that its products do not infringe the Subject Patents. The Company continues to believe that its products do not infringe the Subject Patents
and will vigorously defend the right of its end-users to use its technology.

The Company incurred legal fees of $0.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 related to third party claims against our customers. Such fees

are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

_Claim Against UrbanFT, Inc._

On July 31, 2019, the Company filed a lawsuit against one of its customers, UrbanFT, Inc. (“UrbanFT”) in the United States District Court for the Southern

District of California (case No. 19-CV-1432-CAB-WVG). UrbanFT is delinquent in payment and attempted to justify its non-payment by asserting that the
Company is or may be infringing on unspecified Urban FT patents. The Company filed such lawsuit to collect the delinquent payments and to obtain a declaratory
judgment of non-infringement. UrbanFT filed an answer to the complaint but did not file any cross-claims for infringement. The Company intends to vigorously
pursue its claims and defend against any claims of infringement.

_Other Legal Matters_

In addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company

accrues for such liabilities when it is both (i) probable that a loss has occurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with ASC
450, Contingencies. While any legal proceeding has an element of uncertainty, the Company believes that the disposition of such matters, in the aggregate, will not
have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

**ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.**

_You should read this discussion together with the financial statements, related notes and other financial information included in this Form 10-K. The following_
_discussion may contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed_
_under Item 1A—“Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance_

**Overview**

Mitek is a leading innovator of mobile image capture and digital identity verification solutions. We are a software development company with expertise in

computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. We are currently serving more than 6,500 financial services organizations and leading marketplace
and financial technology (“fintech”) brands across the globe. Our solutions are embedded in native mobile apps and browsers to facilitate better online user
experiences, fraud detection and reduction, and compliant transactions.

Mitek’s Mobile Deposit® solution is used today by millions of consumers in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada for mobile check deposit. Mobile

Deposit® enables individuals and businesses to remotely deposit checks using their camera-equipped smartphone or tablet. Our Mobile Deposit® solution is
embedded within the financial institutions’ digital banking apps used by consumers and has now processed over three billion check deposits. Mitek began selling
Mobile Deposit® in early 2008 and received its first patent issued for this product in August 2010.

Mitek’s Mobile Verify® verifies a user’s identity online enabling organizations to build safer digital communities. Scanning an identity document helps

enable an enterprise to verify the identify of the person with whom they are conducting business, comply with growing governmental Anti-Money Laundering
(“AML”) and Know Your Customer (“KYC”) regulatory requirements, and to improve the overall customer experience for digital onboarding. To be sure the
person submitting the identity document is who they say they are, Mitek’s Mobile Verify Face Comparison provides an additional layer of online verification and
compares the face on the submitted identity document with the live selfie photo of the user.

The combination of identity document capture and data extraction process enables the organization to prefill the end user’s application, with far fewer key

strokes, thus reducing keying errors, and improving both operational efficiency and the customer experience. Today, the financial services verticals (banks, credit
unions, lenders, payments processors, card issuers, fintech companies, etc.) represent the greatest percentage of use of our solutions, but there is accelerated
adoption by marketplaces, sharing economy, and hospitality sectors. Mitek uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to constantly improve the product
performance of Mobile Verify® such as speed and accuracy of approvals of identification documents. The core of our user experience is driven by Mitek
MiSnap™, the leading image capture technology, which is incorporated across our product lines. It provides a simple, intuitive, and superior user-experience,
making digital transactions faster, more accurate, and easier for the consumer. Mobile Fill® automates application prefill of any form with user data by simply
snapping a picture of the driver’s license or other similar user identity document.

CheckReader™ enables financial institutions to automatically extract data from a check image received across any deposit channel – branch, ATM, RDC,

and mobile. Through the automatic recognition of all fields on checks, whether handwritten or machine print, CheckReader™ speeds the time to deposit for banks
and customers and helps enable financial institutions to comply with check clearing regulations.

We market and sell our products and services worldwide through internal, direct sales teams located in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America as well as

through channel partners. Our partner sales strategy includes channel partners who are financial services technology providers and identity verification providers.
These partners integrate our products into their solutions to meet the needs of their customers.

**_Fiscal Year 2019 Highlights_**

-  We added new patents to our portfolio during fiscal year 2019, bringing our total number of issued patents to 57 as of September 30, 2019. In addition,
we have 25 patent applications as of September 30, 2019.

**_Acquisition of A2iA Group II, S.A.S._**

On May 23, 2018, Mitek acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of A2iA Group II, S.A.S. ("A2iA"), a simplified joint stock company formed

under the laws of France, pursuant to a share purchase agreement, by and among Mitek, each of the holders of outstanding shares of A2iA and Andera Partners,
S.C.A., as representative of the sellers (the “A2iA Acquisition”). A2iA is a software development organization focused on delivering specialized and highly
intelligent data extraction tools that enable customers to optimize their data capture, document processing, and workflow automation capabilities. Upon
completion of the A2iA Acquisition, A2iA became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Mitek. As consideration for the A2iA Acquisition, we (i) made a cash
payment of $26.8 million, net of cash acquired; (ii) issued 2,514,588 shares, or $21.9 million, of Mitek’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common
Stock”); and (iii) incurred liabilities of $0.2 million. The A2iA Acquisition extends our global leadership position in both mobile check deposit and digital identity
verification and combines the two market leaders in document recognition and processing.

**_Acquisition of ICAR Vision Systems, S.L._**

On October 16, 2017, Mitek Holding B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Mitek Holding

B.V.”), acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of ICAR Vision Systems, S.L. ("ICAR") and each of its subsidiaries (the “ICAR Acquisition”), pursuant
to a Share Purchase Agreement (the “ICAR Purchase Agreement”), by and among, Mitek, Mitek Holding B.V., and each of the shareholders of ICAR (the “ICAR
Sellers”). ICAR is a technology provider of identity fraud proofing and document management solutions for web, desktop, and mobile platforms. Upon completion
of the ICAR Acquisition, ICAR became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Mitek Holding B.V. and our indirect wholly owned subsidiary. Under the terms of the
ICAR Purchase Agreement, Mitek Holding B.V. agreed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of ICAR for an aggregate purchase price of up to $13.9 million,
net of cash acquired. On closing, $3.0 million was paid in cash, net of cash acquired and $5.6 million in shares of Common Stock, or 584,291 shares, were issued
to the ICAR Sellers. The ICAR Purchase Agreement also provides for additional payments of up to approximately $5.3 million upon the achievement of certain
financial milestones during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. ICAR is a leading provider of consumer identity verification solutions in Spain and Latin America. The
ICAR Acquisition strengthens our position as a global digital identity verification powerhouse in the consumer identity and access management solutions market.

**Market Opportunities, Challenges, & Risks**

We believe that financial institutions, fintechs, and other companies see our patented solutions as a way to provide a superior digital customer experience to

meet growing consumers demands of trust and convenience online and, at the same time, assist them in meeting regulatory requirements. The value of digital
transformation to our customers is a possible increase in top line revenue and a reduction in the cost of sales and service. As the use of new technology increases,
so does associated fraud and cyber-attacks. The negative outcomes of fraud encompass financial losses, brand damage, and loss of loyal customers. We predict
growth in both our deposits and identity verification products based on current trends in payments, online lending, more stringent regulations, growing usage of
sharing apps and online marketplaces, and the ever-increasing demand for digital services.

Factors adversely affecting the pricing of, or demand for, our digital solutions, such as competition from other products or technologies, any decline in the

demand for digital transactions, or negative publicity or obsolescence of the software environments in which our products operate, could result in lower revenues or
gross margins. Further, because substantially all of our revenues are from a few types of technology, our product concentration may make us especially vulnerable
to market demand and competition from other technologies, which could reduce our revenues.

The sales cycle for our software and services can be lengthy and the implementation cycles for our software and services by our channel partners and

customers can also be lengthy, often as long as six months and sometimes longer for larger customers. If implementation of our products by our channel partners
and customers is delayed or otherwise not completed, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.

Revenues related to most of our on-premise licenses for mobile products are required to be recognized up front upon satisfaction of all applicable revenue

recognition criteria. Revenue related to our SaaS products is recognized ratably over the life of the contract or as transactions are used depending on the contract
criteria. The recognition of future revenues from these licenses is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the term of our license
agreements, the timing of implementation of our products by our channel partners and customers, and the timing of any re-orders of additional licenses and/or
license renewals by our channel partners and customers.

During each of the last few years, sales of licenses to one or more channel partners have comprised a significant part of our revenue each year. This is

attributable to the timing of renewals or purchases of licenses and does not represent a dependence on any single channel partner. If we were to lose a channel
partner relationship, we do not believe such a loss would adversely affect our

programs. Selling and marketing expenses increased $5.7 million, or 26%, to $27.4 million in 2019 compared to $21.7 million in 2018. As a percentage of
revenue, selling and marketing expenses decreased to 32% in 2019 from 34% in 2018. The increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to higher
personnel-related costs of $2.6 million resulting from our increased headcount in 2019 compared to 2018, additional sales and marketing expenses associated with
the A2iA Acquisition of $2.4 million, and higher product promotion costs of $0.7 million in 2019.

_Research and Development Expenses_

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, third party contractor expenses, and other headcount
related costs associated with software engineering and mobile image capture science. Research and development expenses increased $3.3 million, or 21%, to $19.0
million in 2019 compared to $15.7 million in 2018. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 22% in 2019 from 25% in 2018.
The increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to additional research and development costs associated with the A2iA Acquisition of $2.3
million and higher personnel-related costs of $0.9 million resulting from our increased headcount in 2019 compared to 2018.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with

finance, legal, administration and information technology functions, as well as third party legal, accounting, and other administrative costs. General and
administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 16%, to $19.9 million in 2019 compared to $17.1 million in 2018. As a percentage of revenue, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 23% in 2019 from 27% in 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to additional general
and administrative costs associated with the A2iA Acquisition of $1.8 million, higher personnel-related costs of $1.5 million resulting from our increased
headcount in 2019 compared to 2018, third party costs associated with our strategic process of $1.2 million, and higher litigation costs of $0.8 million in 2019
compared to 2018, partially offset by a decrease in executive transition costs of $1.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 and a $1.0 million insurance settlement
received in 2019.

_Acquisition-Related Costs and Expenses_

Acquisition-related costs and expenses include amortization of intangible assets, expenses recorded due to changes in the fair value of contingent

consideration, stock-based compensation, and other costs associated with acquisitions. Acquisition-related costs and expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 8%, to
$7.6 million in 2019 compared to $8.2 million in 2018. As a percentage of revenue, acquisition-related costs and expenses decreased to 9% in 2019 from 13% in
2018. The decrease in acquisition-related costs and expenses is primarily due to a decrease in expenses associated with changes in the fair value of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration of $1.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018, $1.1 million of legal and other integration costs associated with the ICAR and A2iA
Acquisitions which both occurred in 2018, and $1.0 million of executive separation costs associated with the A2iA Acquisition which was incurred in 2018. These
decreases are partially offset by an increase expense related to the amortization of intangible assets associated with the A2iA Acquisition of $3.0 million in 2019
compared to 2018.

_Restructuring Costs_

Restructuring costs consist of employee severance obligations and other related costs. Restructuring costs were $3.1 million in 2019 and related to the

restructuring plan implemented in June 2019.

_Other Income (Expense), Net_

Other income (expense), net includes interest income net of amortization and net realized gains or losses on our marketable securities portfolio, foreign

currency transactional gains or losses, and interest expense. Other income (expense), net increased $1.5 million, to a net income of $0.6 million in 2019 compared
to a net expense of $0.9 million in 2018, primarily due to a $1.3 million foreign currency exchange remeasurement loss on the Euro for the acquisition of A2iA in
2018 as well as higher interest income earned on our cash balances in 2019 compared to 2018.

_Income Tax Benefit (Provision)_

The income tax benefit for 2019 was $3.3 million compared to an income tax provision of $3.1 million in 2018. The income tax benefit for 2019 is

primarily due to changes in our deferred tax benefit of $3.2 million related to excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, as well as additional research
and development credits associated with the provision to return true-up. The income tax provision for 2018 is primarily due to $4.9 million of tax expense related
to the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”).
The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the Federal Corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This expense was partially offset by an income tax benefit
related to our net loss before income taxes for the year (see Note 8 in the Consolidated Financial Statements).

to 2017, as well as additional research and development costs of $2.5 million associated with the A2iA Acquisition and ICAR Acquisition, both of which occurred
during fiscal 2018.

_General and Administrative Expenses_

General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with

finance, legal, administration and information technology functions, as well as third party legal, accounting, and other administrative costs. General and
administrative expenses increased $5.8 million, or 51%, to $17.1 million in 2018 compared to $11.3 million in 2017. As a percentage of revenue, general and
administrative expenses increased to 27% in 2018 from 25% in 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs of $2.9 million resulting from our increased headcount and an increase in executive transition costs of $1.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017, as well
as additional general and administrative costs of $0.9 million associated with the A2iA Acquisition and ICAR Acquisition, both of which occurred during fiscal
2018.

_Acquisition-Related Costs and Expenses_

Acquisition-related costs and expenses include amortization of intangible assets, expenses recorded due to changes in the fair value of contingent

consideration, stock-based compensation, and other costs associated with acquisitions. Acquisition-related costs and expenses increased $5.9 million, or 250%, to
$8.2 million in 2018 compared to $2.4 million in 2017. As a percentage of revenue, acquisition-related costs and expenses increased to 13% in 2018 from 5% in
2017. The increase in acquisition-related costs and expenses is primarily due to $3.4 million in additional expense related the amortization of intangible assets and
$0.9 million of additional legal and other integration costs related to the A2iA Acquisition and the ICAR Acquisition, $1.0 million of employee termination costs
associated with the A2iA Acquisition, and an increase of $0.5 million in expense due to changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration.

_Other Income (Expense), Net_

Other income (expense), net includes interest income net of amortization and net realized gains or losses on our marketable securities portfolio, foreign

currency transactional gains or losses, and interest expense. Other income (expense), net decreased $1.3 million, to a net expense of $0.9 million in 2018 compared
to a net income of $0.4 million in 2017, primarily due to a $1.3 million foreign currency exchange remeasurement loss on the Euro for the acquisition of A2iA.

_Income Tax Benefit (Provision)_

The income tax provision for 2018 was $3.1 million compared to an income tax benefit of $10.9 million in 2017. The income tax provision for 2018 is

primarily due to $4.9 million of tax expense related to the revaluation of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act. The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the Federal Corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This expense was partially offset by an income tax
benefit related to our net loss before income taxes for the year. The income tax benefit in 2017 primarily represents the reversal of our valuation allowance
previously offsetting our deferred tax assets (see Note 6 in the Consolidated Financial Statements).

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

On September 30, 2019, we had $34.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and investments compared to $17.5 million on September 30, 2018, an increase

of $17.3 million, or 99%. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities of $14.3 million
and net proceeds from the issuance of equity plan Common Stock of $5.6 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $1.1 million, payment of acquisitionrelated contingent consideration of $1.0 million, unfavorable changes in foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents of $0.4 million, and net payments on
other borrowings of $0.2 million.

_Cash Flows from Operating Activities_

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 was $14.3 million and resulted primarily from a net loss of $0.7 million adjusted for net non
cash charges of $14.6 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.4 million. The primary non-cash adjustments to operating activities
were stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, and depreciation and amortization totaling $9.6 million, $7.0 million, and $1.4 million,
respectively, which were partially offset by changes in deferred income taxes of $3.8 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018 was $5.6 million and resulted primarily from a net loss of $11.8 million adjusted for non-cash

charges of $19.3 million, partially offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $1.9 million. The primary non-cash adjustments to operating
activities were stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and amortization of
closing shares and earnout shares totaling $9.0 million, $4.0 million, $3.6 million, $0.6 million, and $0.4 million, respectively.

_Cash Flows from Investing Activities_

Net cash used in investing activities was $10.5 million during fiscal 2019, which consisted primarily of net purchases of investments of $9.4 million and

capital expenditures of $1.1 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $8.4 million during fiscal 2018, which consisted primarily of net cash paid in conjunction with the acquisitions of

$29.7 million and capital expenditures of $4.3 million, partially offset by net sales and maturities of investments of $25.6 million.

_Cash Flows from Financing Activities_

Net cash provided by financing activities was $4.4 million during fiscal 2019, which consisted of proceeds from the issuance of equity plan Common Stock

of $5.6 million, partially offset by a payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $1.0 million and net payments on other borrowings of $0.2 million.

Net cash used in financing activities was $0.4 million during fiscal 2018, which consisted of a payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration of

$1.3 million and principal payments on other borrowings of $0.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of equity plan Common Stock of $1.1
million.

_Revolving Credit Facility_

On May 3, 2018, the Company and ID Checker, Inc. (together, the “Co-Borrowers”) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”)

with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we arranged for a $10.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) with a
floating per annum interest rate equal to the greater of the Wall Street Journal prime rate, plus 0.25%, or 4.5%. The Co-Borrowers must maintain, at all times when
any amounts are outstanding under the Revolver, either (i) minimum unrestricted cash at SVB and unused availability on the Revolver of at least $15.0 million
and (ii) Adjusted Quick Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 1.75:1.00. In May 2019, the Company and SVB entered into an amendment of the Loan
Agreement to extend the maturity of the Revolver to September 30, 2020. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver as of September 30, 2019.

_Rights Agreement_

On October 23, 2018, we entered into the Rights Agreement and issued a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each share of

Common Stock payable on November 2, 2018 to the stockholders of record of such shares on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder, under certain
circumstances, to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Preferred Shares”), of the
Company, at a price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right (the “Purchase Price”), subject to adjustment. The description
and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement). Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will

have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

At any time prior to the time any Person becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement), the Board may redeem the Rights in whole,

but not in part, at a price of $0.0001 per Right (the “Redemption Price”). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with
such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and
the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.

The Rights will expire on the earlier of (i) the close of business on October 22, 2021, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed, and (iii) the time at

which the Rights are exchanged.

_Other Liquidity Matters_

On September 30, 2019, we had investments of $18.1 million, designated as available-for-sale debt securities, which consisted of U.S. Treasury notes,

commercial paper, and corporate issuances, carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices for identical or similar assets, with unrealized gains and
losses, net of tax, and reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. All securities for which maturity or sale is expected within one year are classified
as “current” on the consolidated balance sheets. All other securities are classified as “long-term” on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2019, we
had $16.5 million of our available-for-sale securities classified as current and $1.6 million of our available-for-sale securities classified as long-term. At September
30, 2018, we had $8.4 million of our available-for-sale securities classified as current.

We had working capital of $34.1 million at September 30, 2019 compared to $17.2 million at September 30, 2018.

Based on our current operating plan, we believe the current cash balance and cash expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our

working capital needs for the next twelve months from the date the financial statements are filed.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 304(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

**Contractual Obligations**

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2019 (in thousands):

Less than

1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years


More than

5 years Total


Operating lease obligations $ 1,699 $ 3,950 $ 2,707 $ 36 $ 8,392

Other borrowings 131 145 219 61 556

Total $ 1,830 $ 4,095 $ 2,926 $ 97 $ 8,948

Our principal executive offices, as well as our research and development facility, are located in approximately 29,000 square feet of office space in San

Diego, California and the term of the lease continues through June 30, 2024. The average annual base rent under this lease is approximately $1.0 million per year.
In connection with this lease, we received tenant improvement allowances totaling approximately $1.0 million. These lease incentives are being amortized as a
reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease.

Our other offices are located in Paris, France; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; New York, New York; Barcelona, Spain; and London, United Kingdom. The

term of the Paris, France lease continues through July 31, 2021, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.4 million (or $0.4 million). The term of the
Amsterdam, The Netherlands lease continues through December 31, 2022, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.2 million (or $0.2 million). The term of
the New York, New York lease continues through November 30, 2024, with an annual base rent of approximately $0.2 million. The term of the Barcelona, Spain
lease continues through May 31, 2023, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.1 million (or $0.1 million). The term of the London, United Kingdom lease
continues through May 31, 2020, with an annual base rent of approximately £63,000 (or approximately $78,000).

Other than the lease for our office space in San Diego, California, we do not believe that the leases for our offices are material

to the Company. We believe our existing properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of its business.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity,
revenue, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions. These estimates
and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and form the basis for
making management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are
inherently uncertain. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting
policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We enter into contractual arrangements with integrators, resellers, and directly with our customers that may include licensing of our software products,

product support and maintenance services, SaaS services, consulting services, or various combinations thereof, including the sale of such products or services
separately. Our accounting policies regarding the recognition of revenue for these contractual arrangements are fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we

expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of
products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized based on the
following five step model in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:

-  Identification of the contract with a customer;

-  Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

-  Determination of transaction price;

-  Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

-  Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.

30


-----

_Software and Hardware_

Software and hardware revenue is generated from on premise software license sales, as well as sales of hardware scanner boxes and on premise appliance

products. For software license agreements that are distinct, we recognize software license revenue upon delivery and after evidence of a contract exists. Hardware
revenue is recognized in the period that the hardware is shipped.

_Service and Other_

Service and other revenue is generated from the sale of transactional SaaS products and services, maintenance associated with the sale of software and

hardware, and consulting and professional services. We recognize service and other revenue over the period in which such services are performed. Our model
typically includes an up-front fee and a periodic commitment from the customer that commences upon completion of the implementation through the remainder of
the customer life. The up-front fee is the initial setup fee, or the implementation fee. The periodic commitment includes, but is not limited to, a fixed periodic fee
and / or a transactional fee based on system usage that exceeds committed minimums. If the up-front fee is not distinct, revenue is deferred until the date the
customer commences use of our services, at which point the up-front fee is recognized ratably over the life of the customer arrangement. We do not view the
signing of the contract or the provision of initial setup services as discrete earnings events that are distinct.

_Significant Judgments_

We use the following methods, inputs, and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize. For multi-element arrangements, we account for

individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct, the good or service is separately identifiable from other items in the
arrangement, and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If these criteria are not met, the
promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining whether goods or services are distinct performance obligations
that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment.

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the customer.

We include any fixed charges within our contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not constrained, we include an
estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and update our assumptions over the duration of the contract. We may constrain
the estimated transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over
which the fees may be adjusted. The transaction price, including any discounts, is allocated between separate goods and services in a multi-element arrangement
based on their relative standalone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using available information such as
market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines. Significant judgment may be required to determine standalone selling prices for each performance
obligation and whether it depicts the amount we expect to receive in exchange for the related good or service.

Contract modifications occur when we and our customers agree to modify existing customer contracts to change the scope or price or both of the contract or

when a customer terminates some, or all, of the existing services provided by us. When a contract modification occurs, it requires us to exercise judgment to
determine if the modification should be accounted for as: (i) a separate contract, (ii) the termination of the original contract and creation of a new contract, or (iii) a
cumulative catch up adjustment to the original contract. Further, contract modifications require the identification and evaluation of the performance obligations of
the modified contract, including the allocation of revenue to the remaining performance obligations and the period of recognition for each identified performance
obligation.

**_Accounts Receivable_**

We consistently monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses that is based on historical experience and on

specific customer collection issues. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that
we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Since our revenue recognition policy requires customers to be deemed
creditworthy, our accounts receivable are based on customers whose payment is reasonably assured. Our accounts receivable are derived from sales to a wide
variety of customers. We do not believe a change in liquidity of any one customer or our inability to collect from any one customer would have a material adverse
impact on our financial position.

**_Investments_**

We determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit

price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We use a fair value hierarchy
with three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, to measure fair value:

31


-----

-  Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

-  Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities; and

-  Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

In using this fair value hierarchy, management may be required to make assumptions about pricing by market participants and assumptions about risk,

specifically when using unobservable inputs to determine fair value. These assumptions are subjective in nature and may significantly affect our results of
operations.

**_Fair Value of Equity Instruments_**

The valuation of certain items, including compensation expense related to equity awards granted, involves significant estimates based on underlying

assumptions made by management. The valuation of stock options is based upon a Black-Scholes valuation model, which involves estimates of stock volatility,
expected life of the instruments and other assumptions. The valuation of performance options, Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Restricted Stock Units, and
similar awards are based upon the Monte-Carlo simulation, which involves estimates of our stock price, expected volatility, and the probability of reaching the
performance targets.

**_Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets_**

Our goodwill resulted from prior acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but intangible assets that are

deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from two to seven years. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements
included in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually or as circumstances indicate that their value may no

longer be recoverable. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”), we review our goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible asset for impairment at least annually in our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a
potential reduction in the fair value of our reporting unit and/or our indefinite-lived intangible asset below their respective carrying values. Examples of such events
or circumstances include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, a significant decline in our stock price, a
significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or the
presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit.

Our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned exceeds

management’s estimate of its fair value. Based on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 350 and ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, (“ASC Topic 280”)
management has determined that the Company operates in one segment and consists of one reporting unit given the similarities in economic characteristics
between our operations and the common nature of our products, services, and customers. Because we have only one reporting unit, and because we are publicly
traded, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value. In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired. Our conclusion that goodwill was not
impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets to our market capitalization.

Because we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our market capitalization, our future reviews of goodwill for impairment may be

impacted by changes in the price of our Common Stock. For example, a significant decline in the price of our Common Stock may cause the fair value of our
goodwill to fall below its carrying value. Therefore, we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of goodwill for impairment a material
impairment charge will not be recorded.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Each period, we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible

assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets are
periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate.
The carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value if the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of
such assets. No impairment charge related to the impairment of intangible assets was recorded during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

-----

**_Business Combinations_**

Accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible

and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and pre-acquisition contingencies. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired include but are not limited to:

-  future expected cash flows from license sales, software services contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired
developed technologies and patents;

-  the acquired company’s trade name, trademark and existing customer relationships, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade
name and trademark will continue to be used in our offerings;

-  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed; and

-  discount rates.

**_Accounting for Income Taxes_**

We estimate income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide

income tax provision. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reflected in our balance
sheets. We then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. When a valuation allowance is established or increased, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statements of
operations. We review the need for a valuation allowance each interim period to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize deferred tax assets
before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which
our deferred tax assets will be realizable.

We recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be

taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to
measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has more than a 50% chance of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate
uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. The evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or
circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits, and effective settlement of audit issues.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax

assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and
negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that
the adjustment is determined to be required.

**_Capitalized Software Development Costs_**

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs incurred for the development of computer software that will be sold, leased, or

otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been established. These capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of
recoverability based on anticipated future revenues and changes in hardware and software technologies. Costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related
overhead. No such costs were capitalized during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 because the time period and cost incurred between
technological feasibility and general release for all software product releases were not material.

Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet our internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the

time of development, are capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during post implementation
operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. The Company defines the design,
configuration, and coding process as the application development stage. The Company capitalized $0.2 million and $0.9 million of costs related to computer
software developed for internal use during the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognized $0.3 million and $0.1 million of
amortization expense from internal use software during the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had no amortization expense
from internal use software during the year ended September 30, 2017.

**ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.**

_Interest Rates_

The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing after-tax yields without significantly

increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we maintain our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities, including
corporate debt securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio, and none of
our investments are held for trading or speculative purposes. Short-term and long-term debt securities are generally classified as available-for-sale and
consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of estimated tax. As of September 30, 2019, our marketable securities had remaining maturities between approximately one and fifteen
months and a fair market value of $18.1 million, representing 13% of our total assets.

The fair value of our cash equivalents and debt securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the

issuers’ credit worthiness. We do not utilize financial contracts to manage our investment portfolio’s exposure to changes in market interest rates. A hypothetical
100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and debt securities due to the
relatively short maturities of these investments. While changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio, any gains or losses will
not be recognized in our results of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be an other-than-temporary impairment.

_Foreign Currency Risk_

As a result of past acquisitions, we have operations in France, the Netherlands, and Spain that are exposed to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange

rate between the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and the British pound sterling. The functional currency of our French, Dutch, and Spanish operations is the Euro. Our results
of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro. Translation adjustments
resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollar equivalents are reported separately in the consolidated statements of
operations and other comprehensive income (loss).

**ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.**

Our financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are set forth at the pages indicated in Part IV, Item 15(a)(1) and (a)(2), respectively,

of this Form 10-K.

**ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.**

None.

**ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.**

**Disclosure Controls and Procedures**

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to

provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial
disclosures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. We recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2019.

**Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a
15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have

34


-----

inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted

an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
_(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal_
control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2019.

Our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated

in their report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2019.

**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we completed the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system. In connection

with this ERP system implementation, we updated our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business
processes and accounting procedures. This ERP system implementation did not have an adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Mitek Systems, Inc.

**Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mitek Systems, Inc. (“Company”) as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the related
consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We have also audited Mitek Systems, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO criteria).

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mitek Systems, Inc. as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

**Adoption of New Accounting Standard**

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers as a result of the
adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective October 1, 2018, under the modified retrospective_
method.

**Basis for Opinion**

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error
or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F-2


-----

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.

**MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEARS ENDED September 30, 2019, 2018, AND 2017**

**1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Nature of Operations**

Mitek Systems, Inc. (“Mitek” or the “Company”) is a leading innovator of mobile image capture and digital identity verification solutions. Mitek is a

software development company with expertise in computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The Company is currently serving more than 6,500
financial services organizations and leading marketplace and financial technology (“fintech”) brands across the globe. The Company’s solutions are embedded in
native mobile apps and browsers to facilitate better online user experiences, fraud detection and reduction, and compliant transactions.

Mitek’s Mobile Deposit® solution is used today by millions of consumers in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada for mobile check deposit. Mobile

Deposit® enables individuals and businesses to remotely deposit checks using their camera-equipped smartphone or tablet. Mitek’s Mobile Deposit® solution is
embedded within the financial institutions’ digital banking apps used by consumers and has now processed over three billion check deposits. Mitek began selling
Mobile Deposit® in early 2008 and received its first patent issued for this product in August 2010. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has been granted 57
patents and it has an additional 25 patent applications pending.

Mitek’s Mobile Verify® verifies a user’s identity online enabling organizations to build safer digital communities. Scanning an identity document helps

enable an enterprise to verify the identity of the person with whom they are conducting business, comply with growing governmental Anti-Money Laundering
(“AML”) and Know Your Customer (“KYC”) regulatory requirements, and to improve the overall customer experience for digital onboarding. To be sure the
person submitting the identity document is who they say they are, Mitek’s Mobile Verify Face Comparison provides an additional layer of online verification and
compares the face on the submitted identity document with the live selfie photo of the user.

The combination of identity document capture and data extraction process enables the organization to prefill the end user’s application, with far fewer key

strokes, thus reducing keying errors, and improving both operational efficiency and the customer experience. Today, the financial services verticals (banks, credit
unions, lenders, payments processors, card issuers, fintech companies, etc.) represent the greatest percentage of use of our solutions, but there is accelerated
adoption by marketplaces, sharing economy, and hospitality sectors. Mitek uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to constantly improve the product
performance of Mobile Verify® such as speed and accuracy of approvals of identification documents. The core of Mitek’s user experience is driven by Mitek
MiSnap™, the leading image capture technology, which is incorporated across the Company’s product lines. It provides a simple, intuitive, and superior userexperience, making digital transactions faster, more accurate, and easier for the consumer. Mobile Fill® automates application prefill of any form with user data by
simply snapping a picture of the driver’s license or other similar user identity document.

CheckReader™ enables financial institutions to automatically extract data from a check image received across any deposit channel – branch, ATM, RDC,

and mobile. Through the automatic recognition of all fields on checks, whether handwritten or machine print, CheckReader™ speeds the time to deposit for banks
and customers and helps enable financial institutions to comply with check clearing regulations.

The Company markets and sells its products and services worldwide through internal, direct sales teams located in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America as

well as through channel partners. The Company’s partner sales strategy includes channel partners who are financial services technology providers and identity
verification providers. These partners integrate the Company’s products into their solutions to meet the needs of their customers.

**Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

_Basis of Presentation_

The financial statements are prepared under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 105
10, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”).

_Principles of Consolidation_

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and

transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

end of ocr table
_Foreign Currency_

The Company has foreign subsidiaries that operate and sell products and services in various countries and jurisdictions around the world. As a result, the

Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks. For those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated
into U.S. dollars equivalents at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using the average
exchange rate over the period. Resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance
sheet. The Company recorded net losses resulting from foreign exchange translation of $3.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, net losses

resulting from foreign exchange translation of $0.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and net gains resulting from foreign exchange translation
of $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.

_Use of Estimates_

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts

of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, deferred taxes, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its
estimates based upon currently available information. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. These estimates include, but are not limited to,
assessing the collectability of accounts receivable, estimation of the value of stock-based compensation awards, fair value of assets and liabilities acquired,
impairment of goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets, standalone selling price related to revenue recognition, contingent consideration, and income taxes.

_Revenue Recognition_

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its related amendments

(collectively known as “ASC 606”). ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The
core principle, involving a five-step process, of the revenue model is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

The Company generates revenue primarily from the delivery of licenses and related services (for both on premise and transactional software as a service

(“SaaS”) products), as well as the delivery of hardware and professional services. Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a
customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer which may
be at a point in time or over time. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

_Net Income (Loss) Per Share_

The Company calculates net income (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic net income (loss) per share is

based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share also gives effect to all potentially
dilutive securities outstanding during the period, such as restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock options, and Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") shares, if
dilutive. In a period with a net loss position, potentially dilutive securities are not included in the computation of diluted net loss because to do so would be
antidilutive, and the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted net loss is the same.

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the following potentially dilutive common shares were excluded from the net income (loss)

per share calculation, as they would have been antidilutive (amounts in thousands):

**2019** **2018** **2017**

Stock options 1,687 2,806 569

RSUs 2,352 2,580 83

ESPP common stock equivalents 74 71 —

ID Checker earnout shares — — 24

Total potentially dilutive common shares outstanding 4,113 5,457 676

The computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 is as follows (amounts in

_thousands, except per share data):_

**2019** **2018** **2017**

Net income (loss) $ (724) $ (11,807) $ 14,092

Weighted-average shares outstanding—basic 39,341 35,811 33,083

Common stock equivalents — — 2,454

Weighted-average shares outstanding—diluted 39,341 35,811 35,537

Net income (loss) per share:
Basic $ (0.02) $ (0.33) $ 0.43

Diluted $ (0.02) $ (0.33) $ 0.40

_Cash and Cash Equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents are defined as highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company's cash and cash

equivalents are composed of interest and non-interest-bearing deposits and money market funds.

_Investments_

Investments consist of corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company classifies investments as available-for-sale

at the time of purchase and reevaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. All investments are recorded at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and
losses for available-for-sale securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity. The Company evaluates its
investments to assess whether those with unrealized loss positions are other-than-temporarily impaired. Impairments are considered to be other-than-temporary if
they are related to deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely that the Company will sell the securities before the recovery of its cost basis. Realized gains and losses
and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in other income (expense), net
in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss). No other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized in the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

All investments whose maturity or sale is expected within one year are classified as “current” on the consolidated balance sheet. All other securities are

classified as “long-term” on the consolidated balance sheet.

_Fair Value Measurements_

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities are considered representative of

their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of those instruments.

_Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the net invoice value and are not interest bearing. The Company considers receivables past due based on the

contractual payment terms. Allowances for doubtful accounts are established based on various factors including credit profiles of the Company’s customers,
contractual terms and conditions, historical payments, and current economic trends. The Company reviews its allowances by assessing individual accounts
receivable over a specific aging and amount. Accounts receivable are written off on a case-by-case basis, net of any amounts that may be collected. The Company
had $0.1 million of write-offs to the allowance for doubtful accounts for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The Company had no write-offs to the

allowance for doubtful accounts for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. The Company maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.2
million and $0.3 million as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

_Property and Equipment_

Property and equipment are carried at cost. The following is a summary of property and equipment as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 (amounts shown in

_thousands):_

**2019** **2018**

Property and equipment—at cost:

Leasehold improvements $ 3,575 $ 3,825

Equipment 3,041 2,604

Capitalized internal-use software development costs 1,088 916

Furniture and fixtures 526 425

8,230 7,770

Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization (3,999) (3,105)

Total property and equipment, net $ 4,231 $ 4,665

Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are provided using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten

years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation and amortization of property and
equipment totaled $1.4 million, $0.6 million, and $0.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Expenditures for
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations. Total repairs and maintenance expenses were $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the fiscal years
ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

_Long-Lived Assets_

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including license agreements and other intangible assets, when events and circumstances

indicate that these assets may be impaired or in order to determine whether any revision to the related amortization periods should be made. This evaluation is
based on management’s projections of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with each product or asset. If management’s evaluation indicates that the
carrying values of these intangible assets were impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company did not record any impairment of long-lived assets for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and
2017.

_Capitalized Software Development Costs_

Costs incurred for the development of software that will be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are capitalized when technological feasibility has been

established. Software development costs consist primarily of compensation of development personnel and related overhead incurred to develop new products and
upgrade and enhance the Company’s current products, as well as fees paid to outside consultants. Capitalization of software development costs ceases and
amortization of capitalized software development costs commences when the products are available for general release. For the fiscal years ended September 30,
2019 and 2018, no software development costs were capitalized because the time period and cost incurred between technological feasibility and general release for
all software product releases were not material. The Company had no amortization expense from capitalized software costs during the years ended September 30,
2019, 2018, or 2017.

Costs related to software acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet our internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the

time of development, are capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during post implementation
operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. The Company defines the design,
configuration, and coding process as the application development stage. The Company capitalized $0.2 million and $0.9 million of costs related to computer
software developed for internal use during the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company recognized $0.3 million and $0.1 million of
amortization expense from internal use software during the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had no amortization expense
from internal use software during the year ended September 30, 2017.

_Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets_

The Company’s goodwill resulted from prior acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for

impairment at least annually or as circumstances indicate that their value may no longer be recoverable. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—
_Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”), the Company reviews its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment at least annually in its fiscal fourth_
quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of its reporting unit and/or its indefinitelived intangible asset below their respective carrying values. Examples of such events or circumstances include: a significant adverse change in legal factors or in
the business climate, a significant decline in the Company’s stock price, a significant decline in the Company’s projected revenue

F-11


-----

or cash flows, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, or the presence of other indicators that would
indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit.

The Company’s goodwill is considered to be impaired if management determines that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has

been assigned exceeds management’s estimate of its fair value. Based on the guidance provided by ASC Topic 350 and ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting
(“ASC Topic 280”), management has determined that the Company operates in one segment and consists of one reporting unit given the similarities in economic
characteristics between its operations and the common nature of its products, services and customers. Because the Company has only one reporting unit, and
because the Company is publicly traded, the Company determines the fair value of the reporting unit based on its market capitalization as it believe this represents
the best evidence of fair value. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, management completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that the Company’s
goodwill was not impaired. The Company’s conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of its net assets to its market capitalization.

Because the Company determines the fair value of its reporting unit based on its market capitalization, the Company’s future reviews of goodwill for

impairment may be impacted by changes in the price of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"). For example, a significant decline in the
price of the Company’s Common Stock may cause the fair value of its goodwill to fall below its carrying value. Therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance
that when it completes its future reviews of goodwill for impairment, a material impairment charge will not be recorded.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Each period, the Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of its

intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The carrying amounts of these assets
are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate.
The carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value if the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the carrying amount of
such assets. No impairment charge related to the impairment of intangible assets was recorded during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

_Guarantees_

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is not subject to potential obligations under guarantees that fall within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 460,

_Guarantees (“ASC 460”), except for standard indemnification and warranty provisions that are contained within many of the Company’s customer license and_
service agreements and certain supplier agreements, and give rise only to the disclosure requirements prescribed by ASC 460. Indemnification and warranty
provisions contained within the Company’s customer license and service agreements and certain supplier agreements are generally consistent with those prevalent
in the Company’s industry. The Company has not historically incurred significant obligations under customer indemnification or warranty provisions and does not
expect to incur significant obligations in the future. Accordingly, the Company does not maintain accruals for potential customer indemnification or warrantyrelated obligations.

_Loss Contingencies_

The Company records its best estimates of a loss contingency when it is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a range of

loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional
information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to the Company’s pending loss contingency and revises its estimates. The
Company discloses contingencies if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss or a material additional loss may have been incurred. The
Company’s legal costs are expensed as incurred.

_Other Borrowings_

The Company has certain loan agreements with Spanish government agencies which were assumed when the Company acquired ICAR. These agreements

have repayment periods of five to twelve years and bear no interest. As of September 30, 2019, $0.6 million, was outstanding under these agreements and
approximately $0.2 million and $0.4 million is recorded in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.
As of September 30, 2018, $0.8 million, was outstanding under these agreements and $0.3 million and $0.5 million is recorded in other current liabilities and other
non-current liabilities, respectively.

_Income Taxes_

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary

differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
future years.

F-12


-----

Management evaluates the available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets. The valuation

allowance reduces deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management’s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not
will be realized. See Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on

examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. See
Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details.

_Stock-Based Compensation_

The Company issues RSUs, stock options, performance options, and Senior Executive Long-Term Incentive Restricted Stock Units (“Senior Executive

Performance RSUs”) as awards to its employees. Additionally, eligible employees may participate in the Company’s ESPP. Employee stock awards are measured
at fair value on the date of grant and expense is recognized using the straight-line single-option method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—
_Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Forfeitures are recorded as they occur._

The Company assigns fair value to RSUs based on the closing stock price of its Common Stock on the date of grant.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options and ESPP shares using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing

model requires subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. The
expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free rate
selected to value any particular grant is based on the U.S. Treasury rate that corresponds to the expected life of the grant effective as of the date of the grant. The
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price. These factors could change in the future, affecting the determination of stockbased compensation expense in future periods.

The Company estimates the fair value of performance options, Senior Executive Performance RSUs, and similar awards using the Monte-Carlo simulation.

The Monte-Carlo simulation requires subjective assumptions, including the Company’s valuation date stock price, the annual risk-free interest rate, expected
volatility, the probability of reaching the stock performance targets, and a 20-trading-day average stock price.

_Advertising Expense_

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018,

and 2017, respectively.

_Research and Development_

Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred.

_Leases_

Leases are reviewed and classified as capital or operating at their inception. For leases that contain rent escalations, the Company records the total rent

payable on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The difference between rent payments and straight-line rent expense is recorded as deferred rent.

_Segment Reporting_

FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires the use of a management approach in identifying segments of an enterprise. During the fiscal year

ended September 30, 2019, management determined that the Company has only one operating segment: the development, sale, and service of proprietary software
solutions related to mobile imaging.

_Comprehensive Income (Loss)_

Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss), unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, and foreign currency translation

adjustments. Included on the consolidated balance sheet is an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $4.1 million and $0.6 million at September 30, 2019 and
2018, respectively.

**Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements**

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other

_Than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which eliminates the current prohibition on immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity_
transfers of assets other than inventory, with the intent of reducing complexity and diversity in practice. Under ASU 2016-16, entities must recognize the income
tax consequences when the transfer occurs rather than deferring recognition. For public entities, ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities must apply the guidance on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and the
adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASC 606 to replace existing revenue recognition rules with a single comprehensive model to use in

accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or
services for an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASC 606 requires expanded
disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

The Company adopted ASC 606 on October 1, 2018 for all contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date using the modified retrospective

method and the practical expedient was not applied. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an
adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting
standards in effect for those periods. The Company expects the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard to be immaterial to our net income on an
ongoing basis.

See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising

from contracts with customers.

**Change in Significant Accounting Policy**

Except for the changes below, the Company has consistently applied the accounting policies to all periods presented in its consolidated financial statements.

The details of the significant changes and quantitative impact of the changes are disclosed below.

_Contract Assets and Liabilities_

The Company previously recognized license revenue on term licenses and transactional SaaS revenue on the date payments become due and payable. Under

ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the license or transactional SaaS service is transferred to the customer. The Company records a
contract asset when the revenue is recognized prior to the date payments become due.

Contract assets that are expected to be paid within one year are recorded in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. All other contract assets are

recorded in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. When the performance obligation is expected
to be fulfilled within one year, the deferred revenue is recorded in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. When the performance obligation is
expected to be fulfilled beyond one year, the deferred revenue is recorded in non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports net
contract asset or liability positions on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.

_Contract Acquisition Costs_

The Company previously recognized commission costs in the period earned if the contract was for one year or less. Under ASC 606, when the commission

rate for a customer renewal is not commensurate with the commission rate for a new contract, the commission is capitalized if expected to be recovered. Such costs
are capitalized on a contract-by-contract basis and amortized using a portfolio approach consistent with the pattern of transfer of the good or service to which the
asset relates. Contract acquisition costs are recorded in other current and non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for

_Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), which requires hosting arrangements that are_
service contracts to follow the guidance for internal-use software to determine which implementation costs can be capitalized. ASU 2018-15 is effective either
prospectively or retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure

_Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, to eliminate, add, and modify certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Entities will no longer be_
required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, but public companies will be required to
disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance is effective for annual
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, but entities are permitted to early adopt either the entire standard or only the provisions that eliminate or
modify the requirements. The Company is currently evaluating how to apply the new guidance.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU

2018-02”). Under previously existing GAAP, the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recorded as a component of income tax
expense in the period in which the law was enacted. When deferred tax balances related to items originally recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
are adjusted, certain tax effects become stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow a reclassification from
accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act”). The amendments in this ASU also require certain disclosures about stranded tax effects. The guidance is required for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018 (our fiscal year 2020), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption in any period is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption
of ASU 2018-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU

2017-04”), which eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Rather, entities should apply the
same impairment assessment to all reporting units and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair
value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment
for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. ASU 2017-04 will be effective prospectively for annual or interim goodwill
impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial

_Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires entities to use a Current Expected Credit Loss model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses_
rather than incurred losses. Under this model, an entity would recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows that the
entity does not expect to collect from financial assets measured at amortized cost. The entity’s estimate would consider relevant information about past events,
current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 31,
2019 with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 201613 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modified lease accounting for both lessees and lessors

to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous
accounting standards and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use
asset for each lease with a term longer than twelve months. The recognized liability is measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid, and the
corresponding asset represents the lessee’s right to use the underlying asset over the lease term and is based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments. For
income statement purposes, the standard retains the dual model with leases classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line
expense while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern. The standard prescribes a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing
at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No.
2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-11, Leases
_(Topic 842)—Targeted Improvements; ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors; ASU No. 2019-01, Codification Improvements to Topic 842;_
and ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842). ASU No. 2018-11
provides an additional transition method allowing entities to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of
fiscal 2020.

F-16


-----

The Company plans to adopt this accounting standard update using the optional transition method in ASU 2018-11. Under this method, the Company will

not adjust its comparative period financial statements for the effects of the new standard or make the new, expanded required disclosures for periods prior to the
effective date. The Company will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance in ASU 2016-02 to not reassess prior
conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs. In addition, the Company will make an accounting policy election that
will keep leases with an initial term of twelve months or less off the consolidated balance sheet. The Company will also elect the practical expedient not to separate
the non-lease components of a contract from the lease component to which they relate.

The adoption of the new lease standard is expected to result in the recognition of lease liabilities of $7.9 million to $8.4 million and right-of-use assets of

$6.5 million to $7.0 million, which include the impact of existing deferred rents and tenant improvement allowances, on the consolidated balance sheet as of
October 1, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and other
comprehensive income (loss) or consolidated statements of cash flows.

No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the year ended September 30, 2019 had, or is expected to have, a material impact on the

Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**2. REVENUE RECOGNITION**

**Nature of Goods and Services**

The following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates its revenue. Contracts with customers are evaluated on a contract
by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.

_Software and Hardware_

Software and hardware revenue is generated from on premise software license sales, as well as sales of hardware scanner boxes and on premise appliance

products. For software license agreements that are distinct, the Company recognizes software license revenue upon delivery and after evidence of a contract exists.
Hardware revenue is recognized in the period that the hardware is shipped.

_Service and Other_

Service and other revenue is generated from the sale of transactional SaaS products and services, maintenance associated with the sale of software and

hardware, and consulting and professional services. The Company recognizes service and other revenue over the period in which such services are performed. The
Company’s model typically includes an up-front fee and a periodic commitment from the customer that commences upon completion of the implementation
through the remainder of the customer life. The up-front fee is the initial setup fee, or the implementation fee. The periodic commitment includes, but is not limited
to, a fixed periodic fee and / or a transactional fee based on system usage that exceeds committed minimums. If the up-front fee is not distinct, revenue is deferred
until the date the customer commences use of the Company’s services, at which point the up-front fee is recognized ratably over the life of the customer
arrangement. The Company does not view the signing of the contract or the provision of initial setup services as discrete earnings events that are distinct.

**Significant Judgments in Application of the Guidance**

The Company uses the following methods, inputs, and assumptions in determining amounts of revenue to recognize:

_Identification of Performance Obligations_

For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, which include combinations of software licenses, maintenance, and services, the Company

accounts for individual goods or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct. The good or service is distinct if the good or service is separately
identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. If
these criteria are not met, the promised goods or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.

_Determination of Transaction Price_

The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the

customer. The Company includes any fixed charges within its contracts as part of the total transaction price. To the extent that variable consideration is not
constrained, the Company includes an estimate of the variable amount, as appropriate, within the total transaction price and updates its assumptions over the
duration of the contract. As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant financing component if, at
contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less.

end of ocr table
_Assessment of Estimates of Variable Consideration_

Many of the Company’s contracts with customers contain some component of variable consideration; however, the constraint will generally not result in a

reduction in the estimated transaction price for most forms of variable consideration. The Company may constrain the estimated transaction price in the event of a
high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount owed because of an extended length of time over which the fees may be adjusted.

_Allocation of Transaction Price_

The transaction price, including any discounts, is allocated between separate goods and services in a contract that contains multiple performance obligations

based on their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells each good
or service. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices using available information such as market conditions and
internally approved pricing guidelines. In instances where there are observable selling prices for professional services and support and maintenance, the Company
may apply the residual approach to estimate the standalone selling price of software licenses. In certain situations, primarily transactional SaaS revenue described
above, the Company allocates variable consideration to a series of distinct goods or services within a contract. The Company allocates variable payments to one or
more, but not all, of the distinct goods or services or to a series of distinct goods or services in a contract when (i) the variable payment relates specifically to the
Company’s efforts to transfer the distinct good or service and (ii) the variable payment is for an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the
Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to its customer.

**Disaggregation of Revenue**

The following table presents the Company's revenue disaggregated by major product category (amounts in thousands):

**Twelve Months Ended September 30,**

**2019** **2018** **2017**

Major product category

Deposits software and hardware $ 41,860 $ 33,071 $ 25,407

Deposits service and other 15,170 8,437 6,963

Deposits revenue 57,030 41,508 32,370

Identity verification software and hardware 4,985 7,627 4,240

Identity verification service and other 22,575 14,424 8,780

Identity verification revenue 27,560 22,051 13,020

Total revenue $ 84,590 $ 63,559 $ 45,390

Software and hardware revenue is generated from on premise software license sales, as well as sales of hardware scanner boxes and on premise appliance

products. Service and other revenue is generated from the sale of transactional SaaS products and services, maintenance associated with the sale of software and
hardware, and consulting and professional services.

**Contract Balances**

The following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers (amounts in thousands):

**September 30, 2019** **October 1, 2018**

Contract assets, current $ 2,350 $ 169

Contract assets, non-current 581 507

Contract liabilities, current 5,612 4,281

Contract liabilities, non-current 736 485

Contract assets, reported within current assets and other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily result from revenue being recognized

when a license is delivered and payments are made over time. Contract liabilities primarily relate to advance consideration received from customers, deferred
revenue, for which transfer of control occurs, and therefore revenue is recognized, as services are provided. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or
liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The Company recognized $4.4 million of revenue during the year ended
September 30, 2019 that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.

-----

**Contract Costs**

The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract, consisting primarily of sales commissions incurred only if a contract is obtained. Capitalized

sales commissions included in other current and non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets totaled $1.5 million and $1.0 million at September 30, 2019
and October 1, 2018, respectively.

Capitalized contract costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates. The amortization period also considers expected

customer lives and whether the asset relates to goods or services transferred under a specific anticipated contract. These costs are included in selling and marketing
expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and totaled $0.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2019. There was no impairment loss recognized

during the year ended September 30, 2019 related to capitalized contract costs.

**3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

_A2iA Group II, S.A.S._

On May 23, 2018, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of A2iA Group II, S.A.S. ("A2iA"), a simplified joint stock company

formed under the laws of France, pursuant to a share purchase agreement, by and among the Company, each of the holders of outstanding shares of A2iA and
Andera Partners, S.C.A., as representative of the sellers (the “A2iA Acquisition”). A2iA is a software development organization focused on delivering specialized
and highly intelligent data extraction tools that enable customers to optimize their data capture, document processing, and workflow automation capabilities. Upon
completion of the A2iA Acquisition, A2iA became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The A2iA Acquisition extends Mitek’s global leadership
position in both mobile check deposit and digital identity verification and combines the two market leaders in document recognition and processing.

As consideration for the A2iA Acquisition, the Company (i) made a cash payment of $26.8 million, net of cash acquired; (ii) issued 2,514,588 shares, or

$21.9 million, of the Company’s Common Stock; and (iii) incurred transaction related liabilities of $0.2 million.

The Company incurred $2.2 million of expense in connection with the A2iA Acquisition primarily related to legal fees, outside service costs, and travel

expense, which are included in acquisition-related costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss).

On May 23, 2018, the Company deposited $0.7 million of the cash payment and 508,479 shares, or $4.4 million, of Common Stock into an escrow fund to

serve as collateral and partial security for certain indemnification rights of the Company. The escrow fund will be maintained for up to 24 months following the
completion of the A2iA Acquisition or until such earlier time as the escrow fund is exhausted.

The Company used cash on hand for the cash paid on May 23, 2018.

_ICAR Vision Systems, S.L._

On October 16, 2017, Mitek Holding B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company

(“Mitek Holding B.V.”), acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of ICAR, a company incorporated under the laws of Spain (the “ICAR Acquisition”),
and each of its subsidiaries, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among, the Company, Mitek Holding B.V., and each of
the shareholders of ICAR (the “Sellers”). ICAR is a technology provider of identity fraud proofing and document management solutions for web, desktop, and
mobile platforms. Upon completion of the ICAR Acquisition, ICAR became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Mitek Holding B.V. and an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company. ICAR is a leading provider of consumer identity verification solutions in Spain and Latin America. The ICAR Acquisition
strengthens the Company’s position as a global digital identity verification powerhouse in the Consumer Identity and Access Management solutions market.

As consideration for the ICAR Acquisition, the Company agreed to an aggregate purchase price of up to $13.9 million, net of cash acquired. On October 16,

2017, the Company: (i) made a cash payment to Sellers of $3.0 million, net of cash acquired and subject to adjustments for transaction expenses, escrow amounts,
indebtedness, and working capital adjustments; and (ii) issued to Sellers 584,291 shares, or $5.6 million, of Common Stock. In addition to the foregoing, the
Sellers may be entitled to additional cash consideration upon achievement of certain milestones as follows: (a) subject to achievement of the revenue target for the
fourth quarter of calendar 2017, the Company will pay to Sellers up to $1.5 million (the “Q4 Consideration”), which amount shall be deposited (as additional
funds) into the escrow fund described below; and (b) subject to achievement of certain revenue and net income targets for ICAR for the twelve-month period
ending on September 30, 2018, and the twelve-month period ending on September 30, 2019, the Company will pay to Sellers up to $3.8 million in additional cash
consideration (the “Earnout Consideration”); provided that if the revenue target set forth in clause (a) is not met, then the Q4 Consideration will instead be added to
the Earnout Consideration payable upon (and subject to) achievement of the revenue and net income targets for the twelve-month period ending on September 30,
2018. The Company estimated the fair value of the total Q4 Consideration and Earnout

Consideration to be $2.9 million on October 16, 2017, which was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology based on financial forecasts determined
by management that included assumptions about revenue growth and discount rates. Each quarter the Company revises the estimated fair value of the Earnout
Consideration and revises as necessary.

The Company incurred $0.5 million of expense in connection with the ICAR Acquisition primarily related to legal fees, outside service costs, and travel

expense, which are included in acquisition-related costs and expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss).

On October 16, 2017, the Company deposited $1.5 million of cash into an escrow fund to serve as collateral and partial security for working capital

adjustments and certain indemnification rights. In April 2018, the Q4 Consideration of $1.5 million was deposited into the escrow fund. As a result of the
achievement of earnout targets during fiscal 2018, the Company paid $1.8 million in January 2019. The Company intends to extend the period over which the
remaining $1.8 million of earnout consideration is earned. A portion of the earnout consideration will be paid during first quarter of fiscal 2020 based on the
achievement of revenue and income targets earned during fiscal 2019. The remaining portion of the earnout consideration will be paid out during the first quarter
of fiscal 2021, which will be based on the achievement of certain revenue, income, development and corporate targets achieved during fiscal 2020. During the first
quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company released all escrow funds, excluding $1.0 million which is being held for any potential settlement relating to the claims which
may arise from the litigation which was brought on by Global Equity & Corporate Consulting, S.L. against ICAR as more fully described in Note 9.

The Company used cash on hand for cash paid on October 16, 2017, and under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to guarantee

the obligations of Mitek Holding B.V. thereunder.

Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the

results of operations of A2iA and ICAR have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of each acquisition. The purchase
price for both the A2iA Acquisition and the ICAR Acquisition have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon
the respective estimates of fair value as of the date of each acquisition, and are based on assumptions that the Company’s management believes are reasonable
given the information currently available.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the year ended September 30, 2018 (amounts

The goodwill recognized is due to expected synergies and other factors and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The Company

estimated the fair value of identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives primarily based on discounted cash flow projections that will arise
from these assets. The Company exercised significant judgment with regard to assumptions used in the determination of fair value such as with respect to discount
rates and the determination of the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented as if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the periods presented and

should not be taken as representative of the Company’s future consolidated results of operations. The following unaudited pro forma information includes
adjustments for the amortization expense related to the identified intangible assets.

The following table summarizes the Company’s unaudited pro forma financial information is presented as if the acquisitions occurred on October 1, 2017

(amounts shown in thousands):

**For the years ended September 30,**

**2019** **2018**

Pro forma revenue $ 86,206 $ 78,130

Pro forma net income (loss) $ 889 $ (12,268)

For the year ended September 30, 2018, revenue of $9.1 million and a net loss of $5.3 million related to the A2iA and ICAR businesses since the respective

acquisition dates are included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.

**4. RESTRUCTURING**

Subsequent to the acquisition of A2iA, the Company evaluated A2iA’s operations and determined that the market for certain products was small and lacking

growth opportunity, were not core to Mitek’s strategy, and were not profitable for the Company. In order to streamline the organization and focus resources going
forward, the Company undertook a strategic restructuring of A2iA’s Paris operations in June 2019, which included, among other things, ceasing the sale of certain
A2iA products and offerings and a reduction in workforce. Restructuring costs consist of employee severance obligations and other related costs and are expected
to be paid over the next twelve months. The following table summarizes changes in the restructuring accrual during the year ended September 30, 2019 (amounts

_shown in thousands):_

Balance at September 30, 2018 $ —

Costs incurred 3,067

Payments (1,473)

Foreign currency effect on the restructuring accrual (68)

Balance at September 30, 2019 $ 1,526

**5. INVESTMENTS**

The Company determines the appropriate designation of investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.

All of the Company’s investments are designated as available-for-sale debt securities. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s short-term investments
have maturity dates of less than one year from the balance sheet date. The Company’s long-term investments have maturity dates of greater than one year from the
balance sheet date.

end of ocr table
Available-for-sale marketable securities are carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices for identical or similar assets, with unrealized gains

and losses, net of taxes, and reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least monthly and
evaluates individual securities with fair value below amortized cost at the balance sheet date. For debt securities, in order to determine whether impairment is otherthan-temporary, management must conclude whether the Company intends to sell the impaired security and whether it is more likely than not that the Company
will be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis. If management intends to sell an impaired debt security or it is more likely than not
the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred. The
amount of an other-than-temporary impairment related to a credit loss, or securities that management intends to sell before recovery, is recognized in earnings. The
amount of an other-than-temporary impairment on debt securities related to other factors is recorded consistent with changes in the fair value of all other availablefor-sale securities as a component of stockholders’ equity in other comprehensive income. No other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized in the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017. There were no realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities during the years ended
September 30, 2019 and 2017. The Company recorded a net realized loss from the sale of available-for-sale securities of $49,000 during the year ended September
30, 2018.

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts, interest, dividend income, and

realized gains and losses are included in investment income.

_Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures_

FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820”) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and

enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under ASC 820 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. ASC 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last
unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which consists of the following:

-  Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

-  Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices
in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities; and

-  Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

in stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding Senior Executive Performance RSUs in the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $0.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding RSUs expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately 1.1 years.

_Performance Options_

On November 6, 2018, as an inducement grant pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer was granted

performance options (the “Performance Options”) to purchase up to 800,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $9.50 per share, the closing market

price for a share of the Common Stock on the date of the grant. As long as he remains employed by the Company, such Performance Options shall vest upon the
closing market price of the Common Stock achieving certain predetermined levels and his serving as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company for at least three
years. In the event of a change of control of the Company, all of the unvested Performance Options will vest if the per share price payable to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the change of control is an amount reaching those certain predetermined levels required for the Performance Options to otherwise
vest. The Company recognized $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding Performance Options in the year ended September 30,
2019. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had $1.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding Performance Options expected to be

_Closing Shares_

On June 17, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of ID Checker NL B.V., a company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands (“IDC

NL”), and ID Checker, Inc., a California corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of IDC NL (“IDC Inc.” and together with IDC NL, “ID Checker”). In
connection with the closing of this acquisition, the Company issued to the Sellers 712,790 shares of Common Stock (the "Closing Shares"). Vesting of these shares
is subject to the continued employment of the founders of ID Checker and occurs over a period of 27 months (the “Service Period”) from the date of issuance. The
cost of the Closing Shares was determined using the fair value of Common Stock on the award date, and the stock-based compensation is recognized ratably over
the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense related to the Closing Shares is recorded within acquisition-related costs and expenses on the consolidated
statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recognized no stock

based compensation expense related to the Closing Shares in the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The Company recognized $1.2 million in stock-based

compensation expense related to the Closing Shares for the year ended September 30, 2017.

_Earnout Shares_

In connection with the acquisition of ID Checker, the Company issued 137,306 shares of Common Stock (the "Earnout Shares") to the Sellers for

achievement by ID Checker of certain revenue targets for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Additionally, 81,182 Earnout Shares were earned by
the Sellers for achievement by ID Checker of certain revenue targets for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016. The Company estimated the fair
value of the Earnout Shares using the Monte-Carlo simulation (using the Company’s valuation date stock price, the annual risk-free interest rate, expected
volatility, the probability of reaching the performance targets, and a 10 trading day average stock price). In November 2017, a contingency triggered the immediate
vesting of all Earnout Shares, resulting in an acceleration of all stock-based compensation related to the earnout shares. Stock-based compensation expense related
to the Earnout Shares is recorded within acquisition-related costs and expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income
(loss). The Company did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense related to the Earnout Shares for the year ended September 30, 2019. The Company
recognized $0.4 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the Earnout Shares for each of the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.

_Rights Agreement_

On October 23, 2018, the Company entered into the Section 382 Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) and issued a dividend of one preferred share

purchase right (a “Right”) for each share of Common Stock payable on November 2, 2018 to the stockholders of record of such shares on that date. Each Right
entitles the registered holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series B Junior Preferred Stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the “Preferred Shares”), of the Company, at a price of $35.00 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right, subject

to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.

The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement). Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will

have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

At any time prior to the time any person becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement), the Board may redeem the Rights in whole,

but not in part, at a price of $0.0001 per Right (the “Redemption Price”). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with
such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and
the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.

The Rights will expire on the earlier of (i) the close of business on October 22, 2021, (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed, and (iii) the time at

which the Rights are exchanged.

On February 28, 2019, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Rights Agreement for the purpose of (i) modifying the definitions of

“Beneficial Owner,” “Beneficially Own,” and “Beneficial Ownership” under the Rights Agreement to more closely align such definitions to the actual and
constructive ownership rules under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”) or such similar provisions of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) adding an exemption request process for persons to seek an exemption from becoming an
“Acquiring Person” under the Rights Agreement in the event such person wishes to acquire 4.9% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding.

_Uncertain Tax Positions_

In accordance with authoritative guidance, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount

that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a
50% likelihood of being sustained.

The following table reconciles the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and

2017 (amounts shown in thousands):

**2019** **2018** **2017**

Gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the year $ 1,321 $ 1,181 $ —

Additions from tax positions taken in the current year 213 140 140

Additions from tax positions taken in prior years 73 — 1,041

Reductions from tax positions taken in prior years — — —

Tax settlements — — —

Gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of the year $ 1,607 $ 1,321 $ 1,181

Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2019, $1.6 million will impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate

that there will be a substantial change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

The Company's practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2019, no accrued

interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company is subject to income taxation in the U.S. at the federal and state levels. All tax years are subject to examination by U.S., California, and other

state tax authorities due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating losses and tax credits. The Company is also subject to foreign income taxes in the countries
in which it operates. The Company’s U.S. federal tax return for the year ended September 30, 2017 is currently under examination. To our knowledge, the
Company is not currently under examination by any other taxing authorities.

**9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

_Claim Against ICAR_

On June 11, 2018, a claim was filed before the Juzgado de Primera Instancia number 5 of Barcelona, Spain, the first instance court in the Spanish civil

procedure system, against ICAR. The claim, also directed to Mr. Xavier Codó Grasa, former controlling shareholder of ICAR and its current General Manager,
was brought by the Spanish company Global Equity & Corporate Consulting, S.L. for the alleged breach by ICAR of a services agreement entered into in the
context of the sale of the shares in ICAR to Mitek Holding B.V.

ICAR responded to the claim on September 7, 2018 and the court process is ongoing.

F-30


-----

The amount claimed is €0.8 million (or $0.9 million), plus the interest accrued during the court proceedings.

Pursuant and subject to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement concerning the acquisition of the shares in ICAR, Mitek Holding B.V. is to be

indemnified in respect of any damages suffered by ICAR and/or Mitek Holding B.V. in respect of this claim.

_Third Party Claims Against Our Customers_

The Company is subject to indemnification demands related to various offers to license patents and allegations of patent infringement against several end
customers. Some of the offers and allegations have resulted in ongoing litigation. The Company is not a party to any such litigation. License offers to and
infringement allegations against the Company’s end-customers were made by Lighthouse Consulting Group, LLC; Lupercal, LLC; Pebble Tide, LLC; Dominion
Harbor Group, LLC; and IP Edge, LLC, which appear to be non-practicing entities (“NPEs”)—often called “patent trolls”—and not the Company’s competitors.
These NPEs may seek to exact settlements from our end-customers, resulting in new or renewed indemnification demands to the Company. At this time, the
Company does not believe it is obligated to indemnify any customers or end-customers resulting from license offers or patent infringement allegations by the
companies listed above. However, the Company could incur substantial costs if it is determined that it is required to indemnify any customers or end-customers in
connection with these offers or allegations. Given the potential for impact to other customers and the industry, the Company is actively monitoring the offers,
allegations and any resulting litigation.

On July 7, 2018, United Services Automobile Association (“USAA”) filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo”) in the Eastern

District of Texas alleging that Wells Fargo’s remote deposit capture systems (which in part utilize technology provided by the Company to Wells Fargo through a
partner), infringe four USAA owned patents related to mobile deposits (the “First Wells Lawsuit”). On August 17, 2018, USAA filed a second lawsuit (the
“Second Wells Lawsuit” and together with the First Wells Lawsuit, the “Wells Lawsuits”) against Wells Fargo in the Eastern District of Texas asserting that an
additional five patents owned by USAA were infringed by Wells Fargo’s remote deposit capture system. Subsequently, on November 6, 2019, a jury in the First
Wells Lawsuit found that Wells Fargo willfully infringed at least one of the Subject Patents (as defined below) and awarded USAA $200 million in damages. The
jury verdict is subject to post-trial motions and appeal by Wells Fargo. The Second Wells Lawsuit is ongoing and no final judgments or awards have been made to
date. Given the potential impact such litigation could have on the use of Mitek’s products by Wells Fargo, our other customers, as well as the industry as a whole,
the Company is closely monitoring the Wells Lawsuits.

While the Wells Lawsuits do not name Mitek as a defendant, given the Company’s prior history of litigation with USAA and the continued use of Mitek’s

products by its customers, on November 1, 2019, the Company filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking
declaratory judgment that its products do not infringe USAA’s U.S. Patent Nos. 8,699,779; 9,336,517; 9,818,090; and 8,977,571 (collectively, the “Subject
Patents”). The Company continues to believe that its products do not infringe the Subject Patents and will vigorously defend the right of its end-users to use its
technology.

The Company incurred legal fees of $0.8 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 related to third party claims against our customers. Such fees

are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

_Claim Against UrbanFT, Inc._

On July 31, 2019, the Company filed a lawsuit against one of its customers, UrbanFT, Inc. (“UrbanFT”) in the United States District Court for the Southern

District of California (case No. 19-CV-1432-CAB-WVG). UrbanFT is delinquent in payment and attempted to justify its non-payment by asserting that the
Company is or may be infringing on unspecified Urban FT patents. The Company filed such lawsuit to collect the delinquent payments and to obtain a declaratory
judgment of non-infringement. UrbanFT filed an answer to the complaint but did not file any cross-claims for infringement. The Company intends to vigorously
pursue its claims and defend against any claims of infringement.

_Other Legal Matters_

In addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business. The Company

accrues for such liabilities when it is both (i) probable that a loss has occurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with ASC
450, Contingencies. While any legal proceeding has an element of uncertainty, the Company believes that the disposition of such matters, in the aggregate, will not
have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

_Employee 401(k) Plan_

The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows participating employees to contribute a percentage of their salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service annual

limits. In 2015, the Company implemented a company match to the plan. The Company's contributions are made in an amount equal to 25% of the first 6% of an
employee's designated deferral of their eligible compensation. The Company's total cost related to the 401(k) plan was $231,000, $123,000, and $121,000 for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

_Facility Lease_

The Company’s principal executive offices, as well as its research and development facility, are located in approximately 29,000 square feet of office space

in San Diego, California and the term of the lease continues through June 30, 2024. The average annual base rent under this lease is approximately $1.0 million per
year. In connection with this lease, the Company received tenant improvement allowances totaling approximately $1.0 million. These lease incentives are being
amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease. As of September 30, 2019, the unamortized balance of the lease incentives was $0.6 million, of
which $0.1 million has been included in other current liabilities and $0.5 million has been included in other non-current liabilities.

The Company’s other offices are located in Paris, France; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; New York, New York; Barcelona, Spain; and London, United

Kingdom. The term of the Paris, France lease continues through July 31, 2021, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.4 million (or $0.4 million). The term
of the Amsterdam, The Netherlands lease continues through December 31, 2022, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.2 million (or $0.2 million). The
term of the New York, New York lease continues through November 30, 2024, with an annual base rent of approximately $0.2 million. The term of the Barcelona,
Spain lease continues through May 31, 2023, with an annual base rent of approximately €0.1 million (or $0.1 million). The term of the London, United Kingdom
lease continues through May 31, 2020, with an annual base rent of approximately £63,000 (or approximately $78,000).

Other than the lease for office space in San Diego, California, the Company does not believe that the leases for the offices are material to the Company. The

Company believes its existing properties are in good condition and are sufficient and suitable for the conduct of its business.

Future annual minimum rental payments payable under the facility and other operating leases are as follows (shown in thousands):

Years ended September 30:

2020 $ 1,699

2021 2,166

2022 1,784

2023 1,554

2024 1,153

Thereafter 36

Total $ 8,392

Rent expense for the Company’s operating leases for its facilities for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017 totaled $2.1 million, $1.7 million

and $0.6 million, respectively.

_Revolving Credit Facility_

On May 3, 2018, the Company and ID Checker, Inc. (together, the “Co-Borrowers”) entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”)

with Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, the Company arranged for a $10.0 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”)
with a floating per annum interest rate equal to the greater of the Wall Street Journal prime rate, plus 0.25%, or 4.5%. The Co-Borrowers must maintain, at all
times when any amounts are outstanding under the Revolver, either (i) minimum unrestricted cash at SVB and unused availability on the Revolver of at least $15.0
million and (ii) Adjusted Quick Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of 1.75:1.00. In May 2019, the Company and SVB entered into an amendment of the
Loan Agreement to extend the maturity of the Revolver to September 30, 2020. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver as of September 30,
2019.

**10. REVENUE AND VENDOR CONCENTRATIONS**

_Revenue Concentration_

For the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company derived revenue of $22.8 million from two customers, with such customers accounting for 17% and

10%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company derived revenue of $20.0 million from two customers,

with such customers accounting for 22% and 10% of the Company's total revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2017, the Company derived revenue of $10.4

million from one customer, with such customer accounting for 23% of the Company’s total revenue. The corresponding accounts receivable balances of customers
from which revenues were in excess of 10% of total revenue were $5.4 million, $5.7 million, and $1.3 million at September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017,
respectively.

The Company’s revenue is derived primarily from the sale by the Company to channel partners, including systems integrators and resellers, and end-users

of licenses to sell products covered by the Company’s patented technologies. In most cases, the channel partners purchase the license from the Company after they
receive an order from an end-user. The channel partners receive orders
