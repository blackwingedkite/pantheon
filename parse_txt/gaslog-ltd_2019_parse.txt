(1) Consists of our 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG, our 50.0% ownership interest in the Cool Pool and our investment
in Gastrade. On October 1, 2015, GasLog, Dynagas and Golar signed an LNG carrier pooling agreement to establish the
Cool Pool to market their vessels which are currently operating in the LNG shipping spot market. The Cool Pool allows the
participating owners to optimize the operation of the pool vessels through improved scheduling ability, cost efficiencies and
common marketing. The objective of the Cool Pool is to serve the transportation requirements of a rapidly growing LNG
shipping market by providing customers with reliable, yet flexible, and innovative solutions to meet their increasingly
complex shipping requirements. The Cool Pool was incorporated in September 2015. In June and July 2018, Dynagas
removed its three vessels from the Cool Pool and renounced its 33% ownership in the Cool Pool. On June 6, 2019, GasLog
entered into a termination agreement with the Cool Pool and Golar, whereby GasLog assumed commercial control of its six
vessels operating in the LNG carrier spot market through the Cool Pool at that time. Following expiry of their
commitments, GasLog vessels were withdrawn from the Cool Pool in June and July 2019. Gastrade is a private limited
company licensed to develop an independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece utilizing an
FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure.

(2) Includes delivered ships (including dry-docking component of vessel cost) as well as office property and other tangible
assets, less accumulated depreciation. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual
report.

(3) The balances as of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 represented the vessel held under finance lease and was included in
the financial statement line ‘‘Vessel held under finance lease’’, which was renamed to ‘‘Right-of-use assets’’ as of January 1,
2019.

(4) Presentation of fleet data does not include newbuildings on order during the relevant periods. The data presented regarding
our owned fleet includes only our owned ships delivered prior to December 31, 2019 including the ships owned by GasLog
Partners. The data presented regarding our managed fleet includes our wholly owned vessels as well as ships owned by
GasLog Partners, Egypt LNG and Lepta Shipping that are or were operating under our management.

(5) The revenue operating days for our owned and bareboat fleet are the total available days after deducting unchartered days.
Available days represent the total number of days in a given period that the vessels (including the _Methane Julia Louise, our_
vessel on a bareboat charter) were in our possession after deducting the total number of days off-hire not recoverable from
the insurers and unavailable days (i.e., periods of commercial waiting time during which we do not earn charter hire, such
as days before and after a dry-docking where the vessel has limited ability for chartering opportunities). In 2019, operating
days include 1,063 days for our vessels operating in the Cool Pool. We define days off-hire as days lost to, among other
things, operational deficiencies, dry-docking for repairs, maintenance or inspection, equipment breakdowns, special surveys
and vessel upgrades, delays due to accidents, crew strikes, certain vessel detentions or similar problems, our failure to
maintain the vessel in compliance with its specifications and contractual standards or to provide the required crew.

(6) **Non-GAAP Financial Measures:**

EBITDA is defined as earnings before depreciation, amortization, financial income and costs, gain/loss on derivatives and
taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange gains/losses, impairment loss on vessels and
restructuring costs. Adjusted EPS represents earnings attributable to owners of the Group before write-off of deferred loan/
bond issuance costs/premium, foreign exchange gains/losses, unrealized foreign exchange losses on cash and bond,
impairment loss on vessels attributable to the owners of the Group, restructuring costs and non-cash gain/loss on derivatives
that includes (if any) (a) unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative financial instruments held for trading, (b) recycled loss of cash
flow hedges reclassified to profit or loss and (c) ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, divided by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that are
used as supplemental financial measures by management and external users of financial statements, such as investors, to
assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist our management
and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. We believe that including
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS assists our management and investors in (i) understanding and analyzing

the results of our operating and business performance, (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment
alternatives and (iii) monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold our
common shares. This is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of, in the case of EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA, financial costs, gain/loss on derivatives, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and, in the case of
Adjusted EBITDA, foreign exchange gains/losses, impairment loss on vessels and restructuring costs; and in the case of
Adjusted EPS, write-off of deferred loan/bond issuance costs/premium, foreign exchange gains/losses, unrealized foreign
exchange losses on cash and bond, impairment loss on vessels attributable to the owners of the Group, restructuring costs
and non-cash gain/loss on derivatives, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods,
financial market conditions, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect results of
operations between periods.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered as
alternatives to, or as substitutes for, or superior to, profit, profit from operations or any other measure of financial
performance presented in accordance with IFRS. Some of these limitations include the fact that they do not reflect (i) our
cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) changes in, or cash
requirements for, our working capital needs and (iii) the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments, on our debt. Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements
for such replacements. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense
items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures
differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.

In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are
the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items.
Therefore, the non-GAAP financial measures as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of
other companies in the shipping or other industries.

**D. Risk Factors**

**Risks Inherent in the LNG Carriers Business**

**_As of March 2, 2020, our owned and bareboat fleet consists of 28 LNG carriers (including the 15 LNG_**
**_carriers owned by GasLog Partners) and seven newbuilds. The majority of our ships currently operate under_**
**_term time charters with six ships trading in the spot market but the charters of a further seven ships will_**
**_terminate in 2020 including six steam vessels and one TFDE vessel. On redelivery, the vessels will trade in the_**
**_short-term spot market unless we are able to secure new term charters. Furthermore, advances in LNG carrier_**
**_technology may negatively impact our ability to recharter the Steam vessels at attractive rates and may result_**
**_in lower levels of utilization. Trading vessels in the spot market, or being unable to recharter the Steam vessels_**
**_on term charters with similar or better rates, means our revenues and cash flows from these vessels will_**
**_decline following expiration of our current charter arrangements. These factors could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our assets, and could_**
**_significantly reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends on our common or Preference shares._**

22 of our owned and bareboat vessels (including 14 of the 15 LNG Carriers owned by GasLog
Partners) and seven of our newbuild vessels currently operate or will operate under term time charters.
Six of our vessels are currently trading in the spot market (including one vessel owned by GasLog
Partners). The Methane Alison Victoria came off charter in January 2020 and is trading in the spot
market. The Methane Rita Andrea is due to come off charter in April 2020 plus up to 30 days at the
charterer’s option and, the _Methane Shirley Elisabeth is due to come off charter in June 2020 plus_
30 days at the charterer’s option. The GasLog Sydney is due to come off charter in June 2020, although
the charterer has the option to extend the time charter for two further periods of 180 days each at
specified rates. The Methane Jane Elizabeth is due to come off charter in November 2020 and the
charterer has several options to extend the charter at varying durations between one and four years at
specified rates. The Methane Heather Sally is due to come off charter in December 2020 plus 30 days at
the charterer’s option. The charter rate for the one year charter of the Methane Jane Elizabeth is lower
than the charter rate which the vessel was earning under her multi-year charter with Shell which
expired in November 2019. While trading in the spot market, the spot market time charter equivalent
(‘‘TCE’’) earnings of the Methane Alison Victoria have been lower than the charter rate which the vessel
was earning under her multi-year charter with Shell which expired in January 2020. In addition, the
_Methane Lydon Volney is due to come off charter during 2020. Our Steam vessels are less efficient and_
have higher emissions than larger, more technologically advanced modern LNG carriers and it may be
more challenging to find spot and/or term employment for these vessels. On February 6, 2020, in light
of reduced expectations for Steam vessel utilization and earnings, GasLog Partners announced that it
will focus its capital allocation on debt repayment, prioritizing balance sheet strength for 2020. As such,
the Partnership expects to reduce its quarterly common unit distribution to $0.125 per unit for the first
quarter of 2020 from $0.561 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2019.

GasLog Partners and GasLog continue to pursue opportunities for new term time charters with
third parties for the vessels trading in the spot market but may have difficulty in securing new charters
at attractive rates and for multi-year durations. In the interim, we may have increased exposure to the
volatile spot market which is highly competitive and subject to significant price fluctuations. In addition,
there may be extended periods of idle time between charters. Moreover, any term charters we are able
to secure for on-the-water vessels may not be as long in duration as the multi-year charters we have
enjoyed in the past and are likely to be at lower charter rates. In recent years, as a result of more LNG
being traded on a short-term basis and greater liquidity in the LNG shipping market, there has been a
decrease in the duration of term charters for on-the-water vessels with such charters now generally
being anywhere between six months and three years in duration. If we are unable to secure
employment for a vessel, we will not receive any revenues from that vessel but we will be required to
pay expenses necessary to maintain the vessel in proper operating condition, as well as servicing the
debt attached to the vessel.


-----

Failure to secure new term charters could adversely affect our future liquidity, results of operations
and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, as well as our ability to meet
certain of our debt obligations and covenants.

A sustained decline in charter rates and employment opportunities could adversely affect the
market value of our vessels, on which certain of the ratios and financial covenants with which we are
required to comply are based, and caused the Group to recognize a non-cash impairment loss of
$162.1 million as of December 31, 2019 for its six Steam vessels built in 2006 and 2007. A significant
decline in the market value of our vessels could impact our compliance with the covenants in our loan
agreements and, if the values are lower at a time when we are attempting to dispose of vessels, could
cause us to incur a loss. If any of our vessels is unable to generate revenues for any significant period
of time for any reason, including unexpected periods of off-hire, early charter termination (which could
result from damage to our vessels) or failure to secure employment for any vessels for which we have
not secured charters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including
cash available for dividends to our shareholders, could be materially and adversely affected. The impact
of any limitation in the operation of our vessels or any early charter termination would be magnified by
the fact that we would still be expending cash to cover the operating costs of the vessel and the costs of
servicing the debt on the vessel, if any. If we are unable to re-deploy a vessel, we will not receive any
revenues from that vessel and we would be required to pay expenses necessary to maintain the vessel in
proper operating condition as well as to service the debt attached to that vessel.

**_If the number of vessels available in the short-term or spot LNG carrier market continues to expand and_**
**_results in reduced opportunities to secure multi-year charters for our vessels, our revenues and cash flows may_**
**_become more volatile and may decline following expiration or early termination of our current charter_**
**_arrangements._**

Most shipping requirements for new LNG projects continue to be secured on a multi-year basis,
although the level of spot voyages and short-term time charters of less than 12 months in duration has
grown in recent years. As vessels currently operating under multi-year charters redeliver, the number of
vessels available in the short-term or spot charter market is likely to continue to expand which may
result in reduced opportunities to secure multi-year charters for our vessels. With our vessels trading in
the short-term or spot market upon expiration or early termination of our current charters, our
revenues and cash flows may become more volatile. In addition, an active short-term or spot charter
market may require us to enter into charters on variable rates depending on market prices at the time,
as opposed to fixed rates, and may result in extended periods of idle time between charters. We have
entered into two multi-year charters with Gunvor for the GasLog Shanghai and the GasLog Salem at
rates which are indexed to estimated market rates for TFDE vessels trading in the spot market. While
these charters ensure 100% utilization of the vessels during the duration of the contracts, a fall in such
estimated market rates would result in a decrease in our revenues. These factors could result in a
decrease in our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.

**_An oversupply of LNG carriers as a result of excessive new ordering may lead to a reduction in the charter_**
**_hire rates we are able to obtain when seeking charters in the future which could adversely affect our results of_**
**_operations and cash flows._**

While we currently believe that the global LNG carrier fleet may experience high levels of
utilization over the next one to two years, the supply of LNG carriers has been increasing as a result of
the ordering and delivery of new ships. The development of liquefaction projects in the United States
for the first time and the anticipation of exports beginning in early 2016 contributed to this significant
ordering activity. Following a decline in ordering of newbuildings during 2016 and 2017, ordering
increased in 2018 and 2019, driven by cyclically low shipyard prices for newbuild vessels, the then
strengthening of charter rates and increasing expectations for long-term LNG supply and demand.


-----

According to Poten, as of March 2, 2020, the global trading fleet of conventional LNG carriers
(>100,000 cbm) consisted of 513 vessels, with another 118 LNG carriers on order, of which 76 have
long-term charters. The large number of ordered newbuildings that remain uncommitted and any future
expansion of the global LNG carrier fleet in excess of the demand for LNG shipping may have a
negative impact on charter hire rates, vessel utilization and vessel values.

If charter hire rates are lower when we are seeking new time charters, or if we are unable to
secure employment for our vessels trading in the spot and short-term markets, as a result of increased
competition from modern vessels, our revenues and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to
shareholders, may decline.

**_In 2020, nine vessels (five GasLog vessels and four GasLog Partners vessels) are scheduled to be dry-docked_**
**_and, in 2021, five GasLog Partners vessels are scheduled to be dry-docked. The dry-dockings for all of these_**
**_vessels will be longer and more costly than normal as a result of the need to install ballast water treatment_**
**_systems (‘‘BWTS’’) on each vessel in order to comply with regulatory requirements. Any delay or cost overrun_**
**_of the dry-docking could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition and could significantly reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends on our common or_**
**_Preference shares._**

Dry-dockings of our vessels require significant expenditures and result in loss of revenue as our
vessels are off-hire during such period. Any significant increase in either the number of off-hire days or
in the costs of any repairs or investments carried out during the dry-docking period could have a
material adverse effect on our profitability and our cash flows. Given the potential for unforeseen
issues arising during dry-docking, we may not be able to predict accurately the time required to
dry-dock any of our vessels. In 2020 and 2021, the dry-dockings will be longer and more costly than
normal as a result of the need to install BWTS on each vessel in order to comply with regulatory
requirements. If more than one of our ships is required to be out of service at the same time, or if a
ship is dry-docked longer than expected or if the cost of repairs is greater than budgeted, our results of
operations and our cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, could be
adversely affected. The upcoming dry-dockings of vessels are expected to be carried out in 2020
(9 vessels), 2021 (5 vessels) and 2023 (8 vessels).

**_Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds. We must make substantial_**
**_capital expenditures to fund the seven newbuildings we have on order as of March 2, 2020, and any_**
**_additional ships we may acquire in the future. In addition, three of our credit facilities are due to mature_**
**_between 2020 and 2022. We cannot guarantee that renewal, replacement or new lines of credit will be_**
**_available or will be available on similar or more favourable terms._**

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and our operating cash flow will be
sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we are
obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to fund our commitments for the seven newbuildings
we have on order. We are scheduled to take delivery of the vessels on various dates during 2020 and
2021. As of December 31, 2019, the total remaining balance of the contract prices for the seven vessels
under construction was $1,113.0 million, which amounts are payable under each shipbuilding contract in
installments upon the attainment of certain specified milestones. The largest portion of the purchase
price for each vessel is payable upon its delivery to us from the shipyard.

To the extent that we are unable to draw down the amounts committed under our existing credit
facilities, whether due to our failure to comply with the terms of such facilities or the lenders’ failure to
fund the committed amounts, or to the extent that we are unable to put in place new debt facilities of
sufficient quantum and on acceptable terms, we will need to find alternative financing. If we are unable
to find alternative financing, we will not be capable of funding all of our commitments for capital
expenditures relating to our seven contracted newbuildings. If we fail to meet our payment obligations

10


-----

under a shipbuilding contract, we would be in default under the applicable contract and the shipbuilder
would have the option of cancelling the contract and retaining any previously funded installment
payments.

Our ability to borrow against the ships in our existing fleet and any ships we may acquire in the
future largely depends on the value of the ships, which in turn depends in part on charter hire rates
and the ability of our charterers to comply with the terms of their charters. The actual or perceived
credit quality of our charterers, and any defaults by them, may materially affect our ability to obtain
the additional capital resources that we will require to purchase additional ships and to refinance our
existing debt as balloon payments come due, or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such
capital. Our inability to obtain additional financing or committing to financing on unattractive terms
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

In addition, we may choose to make substantial further capital expenditures to expand the size of
our fleet and/or to convert existing LNG carriers to FSRUs/FSUs in the future. We expect to finance
the cost of any new vessels, including conversion costs through available cash, cash from operations and
debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets may be
limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, as well as by adverse
market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions, changes in the
LNG industry, changes to banking regulations and further contingencies and uncertainties that are
beyond our control. The recent significant fall in the value of our common shares may make it difficult
or impossible for us to access the equity or equity-linked capital markets. Even if we are successful in
obtaining the necessary funds, the terms of any debt financings could limit our ability further to expand
our fleet and to pay dividends to our shareholders.

The debt of the 13 vessels comprising the credit agreement we entered into on February 18, 2016
to refinance the debt maturities that were scheduled to become due in 2016 and 2017 (the ‘‘Five Vessel
Refinancing’’) and the credit agreement we entered into on July 19, 2016 to refinance the existing
indebtedness on eight of GasLog’s on-the-water vessels of up to $1,050.0 million (the ‘‘Legacy Facility
Refinancing’’) will mature in April and July 2021, respectively. The vessels include four Steam vessels
and nine TFDE vessels. The age of the vessels, recent declines in their estimated fair market values
and the limited charter cover attached to the vessels will make the refinancing of these facilities more
challenging. As a result, securing access to additional funds in advance of the maturity of our debt
facilities cannot be assured on the same or similar terms. Debt financing, if available, may involve
covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt or to pay dividends to our
shareholders. Any debt or additional equity financing raised may contain unfavorable terms to us or
our shareholders. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to liquidate some or all of our
assets, or delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our fleet expansion plans.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

11


-----

**_Our ability to raise capital to repay or refinance our debt obligations or to fund our maintenance or growth_**
**_capital expenditures will depend on certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond_**
**_our control. The recent significant fall in the value of our common shares may make it difficult or impossible_**
**_for us to access the equity or equity-linked capital markets. To the extent that we are unable to finance these_**
**_obligations and expenditures with cash from operations or incremental bank loans or by issuing debt or equity_**
**_securities, our ability to make cash dividends may be diminished, or our financial leverage may increase, or_**
**_our shareholders may be diluted. Our business may be adversely affected if we need to access sources of_**
**_funding which are more expensive and/or more restrictive._**

To fund our existing and future debt obligations and capital expenditures and any future growth,
we will be required to use cash from operations, incur borrowings, and/or seek to access other financing
sources including the capital markets. Our access to potential funding sources and our future financial
and operating performance will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business,
regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to access the
capital markets or raise additional bank financing or generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt,
capital expenditure and other business requirements, we may be forced to take actions such as:

-  restructuring our debt;

-  seeking additional debt or equity capital;

-  selling assets;

-  reducing dividends;

-  reducing, delaying or cancelling our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital
expenditures; or

-  seeking bankruptcy protection.

Such measures might not be successful, available on acceptable terms or enable us to meet our
debt, capital expenditure and other obligations. Some of these measures may adversely affect our
business and reputation. In addition, our financing agreements may restrict our ability to implement
some of these measures. Use of cash from operations and possible future sale of certain assets will
reduce cash available for dividends to shareholders. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access
the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or
offering as well as by adverse market conditions. Following the recent significant fall in the value of our
common shares, we may not be able to access the equity or equity-linked capital markets. Even if we
are successful in obtaining the necessary funds, the terms of such financings could limit our ability to
pay cash dividends to shareholders or operate our business as currently conducted. In addition,
incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and
issuing additional equity securities may result in significant shareholder dilution and would increase the
aggregate amount of cash required to maintain our quarterly dividends to shareholders.

**_We may experience operational problems with vessels that reduce revenues and increase costs. In addition,_**
**_there are risks associated with operating ocean-going ships. Any limitation in the availability or operation of_**
**_our ships could have a material adverse effect on our business, our reputation, financial condition, results of_**
**_operations and cash flows._**

LNG carriers are complex and their operations are technically challenging. Marine transportation
operations are subject to mechanical risks and problems. Operational problems may lead to loss of
revenues or higher than anticipated operating expenses or require additional capital expenditures.

12


-----

Furthermore, the operation of ocean-going ships carries inherent risks. These risks include the
possibility of:

-  marine disaster;

-  piracy;

-  cyber events or other failures of operational and information technology systems;

-  environmental accidents;

-  adverse weather conditions;

-  grounding, fire, explosions and collisions;

-  cargo and property loss or damage;

-  business interruptions caused by mechanical failure, human error, war, terrorism, disease (such
as the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus) and quarantine, or political action in various
countries;

-  declining operational performance due to physical degradation as a result of extensive idle time
or other factors; and

-  work stoppages or other labor problems with crew members serving on our ships.

An accident involving any of our owned ships could result in any of the following:

-  death or injury to persons, damage to our ships, loss of property or environmental damage;

-  delays in the delivery of cargo;

-  loss of revenues from termination of charter contracts;

-  governmental fines, penalties or restrictions on conducting business;

-  litigation with our employees, customers or third parties;

-  higher insurance rates; and

-  damage to our reputation and customer relationships generally.

If any of our ships are unable to generate revenues for any significant period of time for any
reason, including unexpected periods of off-hire or early charter termination (which could result from
damage to our ships), our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including
cash available for dividends to our shareholders, could be materially and adversely affected. The impact
of any limitation in the operation of our ships or any early charter termination would be amplified, as a
substantial portion of our cash flows and income is dependent on the revenues earned by the
chartering of our 28 LNG carriers in operation. In addition, the costs of ship repairs are unpredictable
and can be substantial. In the event of repair costs that are not covered by our insurance policies, we
may have to pay for such repair costs, which would decrease our earnings and cash flows. Any of these
results could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay cash
dividends to our shareholders.

**_A cyber-attack could materially disrupt GasLog’s business._**

GasLog’s business operations could be targeted by individuals or groups seeking to sabotage or
disrupt GasLog’s information technology systems and networks, or to steal data. A cyber-attack could
materially disrupt GasLog’s operations, including the safety of its operations, or lead to unauthorized
release of information or alteration of information on its systems. Any such attack or other breach of
GasLog’s information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on GasLog’s business,

-----

financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our
shareholders. While we have insurance policies in place to cover losses in the event of a cyber related
event, there can be no assurance that any specific event would be covered by these policies or that the
losses would be covered in full.

We are subject to laws, directives, and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention,
disclosure, security and transfer of personal data. These laws, directives and regulations, as well as their
interpretation and enforcement, continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (‘‘GDPR’’), which regulates the use
of personally identifiable information, went into effect in the European Union (‘‘EU’’) on May 25, 2018
and applies globally to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU, to related
products and services that we offer to EU customers and to non-EU customers which offer services in
the EU. The GDPR requires organizations to report on data breaches within 72 hours and be bound
by more stringent rules for obtaining the consent of individuals on how their data can be used.
Complying with the GDPR and similar emerging and changing privacy and data protection
requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices.
Non-compliance with our legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection could result in
penalties, fines, legal proceedings by governmental entities or others, loss of reputation, legal claims by
individuals and customers and significant legal and financial exposure and could affect our ability to
retain and attract customers.

Changes in the nature of cyber threats and/or changes to industry standards and regulations might
require us to adopt additional procedures for monitoring cybersecurity, which could require additional
expenses and/or capital expenditures. However, the impact of such regulations is hard to predict at this
time.

**_Our future success depends on our ability to maintain relationships with existing customers, establish new_**
**_customer relationships and obtain new time charter contracts for existing vessels and/or FSRUs/FSUs, for_**
**_which we face considerable competition from other established companies with significant resources, as well as_**
**_recent and potential future new entrants._**

One of our principal objectives is to enter into multi-year, fixed-rate charters for our open
on-the-water vessels and for potential additional newbuild vessels. We are seeking to enter into time
charter contracts for some or all of the GasLog Saratoga, the Methane Lydon Volney, the GasLog
_Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea and the_ _GasLog Savannah, all of which currently trade in the spot_
market. We will also seek to enter into new time charter contracts upon the expiration or early
termination of our existing charter arrangements, including in respect of the Methane Rita Andrea, the
_Methane Shirley Elisabeth, the Methane Heather Sally, the Methane Alison Victoria and the GasLog_
_Sydney, all of which are owned by GasLog Partners, and the GasLog Saratoga and the Methane Lydon_
_Volney. The process of obtaining multi-year, fixed rate charters for LNG carriers is highly competitive_
and generally involves an intensive screening process by potential new customers and the submission of
competitive bids. The process is lengthy and the LNG carrier time charters are awarded based upon a
variety of factors relating to the ship and the ship operator, including:

-  size, age, technical specifications and condition of the ship;

-  LNG shipping experience and quality and efficiency of ship operations, including level of
emissions;;

-  shipping industry relationships and reputation for customer service;

-  technical ability and reputation for operation of highly specialized ships;

-  quality and experience of officers and crew;

14


-----

-  safety record;

-  the ability to finance ships at competitive rates and financial stability generally;

-  relationships with shipyards and the ability to get suitable berths;

-  construction and dry-docking management experience, including the ability to obtain on-time
delivery of new ships according to customer specifications; and

-  competitiveness of the bid in terms of charter rate and other economic and commercial terms.

We expect substantial competition from a number of experienced companies and recent and
potential future new entrants to the LNG shipping market. Competitors may include other independent
ship owners, state-sponsored entities and major energy companies that own and operate LNG carriers,
all of whom may compete with independent owners by using their own fleets to carry LNG for third
parties. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources and larger fleets than
we have, and some have particular relationships that may provide them with competitive advantages. In
recent years, a number of marine transportation companies, including companies with strong
reputations and extensive resources and experience, have either entered or significantly increased their
presence in the LNG transportation market. There are other ship owners, managers and investors who
may also attempt to participate in the LNG market in the future. This increased competition may cause
greater price competition for time charters. As a result, we may be unable to expand our relationships
with existing customers or to obtain new customers on a profitable basis and we may not be successful
in executing any future growth plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to
shareholders.

**_We derive a substantial majority of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of any_**
**_customer, charter or vessel would result in a significant loss of revenues and could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

We currently derive the majority of our revenues from wholly owned subsidiaries of Shell. We
could lose a customer or the benefits of our time charter arrangements for many different reasons. The
customer may be unable or unwilling to make charter hire or other payments to us because of a
deterioration in its financial condition, commercial disputes with us, long term force majeure events or
otherwise. If a customer terminates its charters, chooses not to re-charter our ships or is unable to
perform under its charters and we are not able to find replacement charters on similar or more
favourable terms, we will suffer a loss of revenues.

Our charterer has the right to terminate a ship’s time charter in certain circumstances, such as:

-  loss of the ship or damage to it beyond repair;

-  if the ship is off-hire for any reason other than scheduled dry-docking for a period exceeding 90
consecutive days, or for more than 90 days in any one year period;

-  defaults by us in our obligations under the charter; or

-  the outbreak of war or hostilities involving two or more major nations, such as the United States
or the People’s Republic of China, that would materially and adversely affect the trading of the
ship for a period of at least 30 days.

A termination right under one ship’s time charter would not automatically give the charterer the
right to terminate its other charter contracts with us. However, a charter termination could materially
affect our relationship with the customer and our reputation in the LNG shipping industry, and in
some circumstances the event giving rise to the termination right could potentially impact multiple
charters.

15


-----

Accordingly, the existence of any right of termination or the loss of any customer, charter or vessel
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.

**_Ship values may fluctuate substantially which has, as at December 31, 2019 in relation to our Steam vessels,_**
**_and could again in future, resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $162.1 million for the six Steam_**
**_vessels built in 2006 and 2007, including five GasLog Partners vessels and one vessel owned by us. A further_**
**_decline in ship values could impact our compliance with the covenants in our loan agreements and, if the_**
**_values are lower at a time when we are attempting to dispose of ships, cause us to incur a loss._**

Values for ships can fluctuate substantially over time due to a number of different factors,
including:

-  prevailing economic conditions in the natural gas and energy markets;

-  a substantial or extended decline in demand for LNG;

-  the level of worldwide LNG production and exports;

-  changes in the supply and demand balance of the global LNG carrier fleet and the size and
contract profile of the LNG carrier orderbook;

-  changes in prevailing charter hire rates;

-  declines in levels of utilization of the global LNG carrier fleet and of our vessels;

-  the physical condition of the ship;

-  the size, age and technical specifications of the ship; and

-  the cost of retrofitting or modifying existing ships, as a result of technological advances in ship
design or equipment, changes in applicable environmental or other regulations or standards,
customer requirements or otherwise.

If the market value of our ships decline, we may be required to record additional impairment
charges in our financial statements, in addition to the impairment charge recorded in the year ended
December 31, 2019, which could adversely affect our results of operations. See ‘‘Item 5. Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources—Critical Accounting Policies—
Impairment of Vessels’’. Deterioration in the market value of our ships may trigger a breach of some of
the covenants contained in our credit facilities. If we do breach such covenants and we are unable to
remedy the relevant breach, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the
ships in our fleet securing those credit facilities. In addition, if a charter contract expires or is
terminated by the customer, we may be unable to redeploy the affected ships at attractive rates and,
rather than continue to incur costs to maintain and finance them, we may seek to dispose of them. Any
foreclosure on our ships, or any disposal by us of a ship at a time when ship values have fallen, could
result in a loss and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.

**_If we cannot meet our charterers’ quality and compliance requirements, including regulations or costs_**
**_associated with the environmental impact of our vessels, we may not be able to operate our vessels profitably_**
**_which could have an adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash flows and financial_**
**_position._**

Customers, and in particular those in the LNG industry, have a high and increasing focus on
quality, emissions and compliance standards with their suppliers across the entire value chain, including
the shipping and transportation segment. There is also increasing focus on the environmental footprint
of marine transportation. Our continuous compliance with existing and new standards and quality

16


-----

requirements is vital for our operations. Related risks could materialize in multiple ways, including a
sudden and unexpected breach in quality and/or compliance concerning one or more vessels and/or a
continuous decrease in the quality concerning one or more LNG carriers occurring over time.
Moreover, continuously increasing requirements from LNG industry constituents can further complicate
our ability to meet the standards. Any non-compliance by us, either suddenly or over a period of time,
on one or more LNG carriers, or an increase in requirements by our charterers above and beyond what
we deliver, may have a material adverse effect on our future performance, results of operations, cash
flows, financial position and our ability to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.

**_The LNG shipping industry is subject to substantial environmental and other regulations which may be_**
**_increased further by the growing global focus on a lower carbon economy, the physical effects of climate_**
**_change and the increasing demand for environmental, social and governance disclosures by investors, lenders_**
**_and regulators._**

Our operations are materially affected by extensive and changing international, national, state and
local environmental laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards which are in force in
international waters, or in the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which our ships operate and in
the countries in which our ships are registered. These requirements include those relating to equipping
and operating ships, providing security and minimizing or addressing impacts on the environment from
ship operations. We may incur substantial costs in complying with these requirements, including costs
for ship modifications and changes in operating procedures. We also could incur substantial costs,
including clean-up costs, civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, the suspension or termination of
operations and third party claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such laws and
regulations. The higher emissions of our Steam vessels relative to more modern vessels could make it
more difficult to secure employment for these vessels and reduce the rates at which we can charter
these vessels to our customers.

In addition, these requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of our ships, require a
reduction in cargo capacity, necessitate ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions or lead
to decreased availability of insurance coverage for environmental matters. They could further result in
the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports or detention in certain ports. We are
required to obtain governmental approvals and permits to operate our ships. Delays in obtaining such
governmental approvals may increase our expenses, and the terms and conditions of such approvals
could materially and adversely affect our operations.

Additional laws, regulations, taxes or levies may be adopted that could limit our ability to do
business or increase our operating costs, which could materially and adversely affect our business. New
or amended legislation relating to ship recycling, sewage systems, emission control (including emissions
of greenhouse gases and other pollutants) as well as ballast water treatment and ballast water handling
may be adopted. For example, the United States has enacted legislation, and more recently a
convention adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (the ‘‘IMO’’) has become effective,
governing ballast water management systems on oceangoing ships. The IMO has also established
progressive standards limiting the sulfur content of fuel, which were phased in on January 1, 2020.
These and other laws or regulations may require additional capital expenditures or operating expenses
(such as increased costs for low sulfur fuel or pollution controls) in order for us to maintain our ships’
compliance with international and/or national regulations. We may also become subject to additional
laws and regulations if we enter new markets or trades.

We also believe that the heightened environmental, quality and security concerns of insurance
underwriters, regulators and charterers will generally lead to additional regulatory requirements and/or
contractual requirements, including enhanced risk assessment and security requirements, as well as
greater inspection and safety requirements on all LNG carriers in the marine transportation market.
These requirements are likely to add incremental costs to our operations, and the failure to comply

17

with these requirements may affect the ability of our ships to obtain and, possibly, recover from,
insurance policies or to obtain the required certificates for entry into the different ports where we
operate.

Some environmental laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or ‘‘OPA’’,
provide for potentially unlimited joint, several and/or strict liability for owners, operators and demise or
bareboat charterers for oil pollution and related damages. OPA applies to discharges of any oil from a
ship in U.S. waters, including discharges of fuel and lubricants from an LNG carrier, even if the ships
do not carry oil as cargo. In addition, many states in the United States bordering a navigable waterway
have enacted legislation providing for potentially unlimited strict liability without regard to fault for the
discharge of pollutants within their waters. We also are subject to other laws and conventions outside
the United States that provide for an owner or operator of LNG carriers to bear strict liability for
pollution, such as the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, or the
‘‘London Convention’’.

Some of these laws and conventions, including OPA and the London Convention, may include
limitations on liability. However, the limitations may not be applicable in certain circumstances, such as
where a spill is caused by a ship owner’s or operator’s intentional or reckless conduct. These limitations
are also subject to periodic updates and may otherwise be amended in the future.

Compliance with OPA and other environmental laws and regulations also may result in ship
owners and operators incurring increased costs for additional maintenance and inspection requirements,
the development of contingency arrangements for potential spills, obtaining mandated insurance
coverage and meeting financial responsibility requirements.

Increased concern over climate change could lead to a more negative perception of the oil and gas
industry which could impact our ability to attract investors, access financing in the bank and capital
markets and attract and retain talent.

**_Further technological advancements and other innovations affecting LNG carriers could reduce the charter_**
**_hire rates we are able to obtain when seeking new employment for existing or newbuild vessels and this could_**
**_adversely impact the value of our assets and our results of operations and cash flows._**

The charter rates, asset value and operational life of an LNG carrier are determined by a number
of factors, including the ship’s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency is reflected
in unit freight costs (‘‘UFC’’) which are driven by the size of the vessel, its fuel economy and the rate
at which LNG in the cargo tanks naturally evaporates (‘‘boil-off ratio’’ or ‘‘BOR’’). Flexibility is
primarily driven by the size of the ship and includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking
facilities and pass through canals and straits. Physical life is related to the original design and
construction, the ongoing maintenance and the impact of operational stresses on the asset. Ship, cargo
containment and engine designs are continually evolving. At such time as newer designs are developed
and accepted in the market, these newer vessels may be more efficient or more flexible or have longer
physical lives than our ships. Competition from these more technologically advanced LNG carriers
compared to our vessels with older technology could adversely affect our ability to charter or re-charter
our ships and the charter hire rates we will be able to secure when we seek to charter or re-charter our
ships, and could also reduce the resale value of our ships. This could adversely affect our revenues and
cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders, as well as our ability to obtain
debt financing for ships with older technology whose market values have experienced a significant
decline.

**_Our future performance and ability to secure future employment for our vessels depends on continued growth_**
**_in LNG production and demand for LNG and LNG shipping._**

Our future performance, including our ability to strengthen our balance sheet and to profitably
employ and expand our fleet, will depend on continued growth in LNG supply and demand, and the
demand for shipping. A complete LNG project includes natural gas production, liquefaction, storage,
regasification and distribution facilities, in addition to marine transportation of LNG. Growth in LNG
demand and increased infrastructure investment has led to an expansion of LNG production capacity in
recent years, but material delays in the construction or slower than expected ramp-up of new
liquefaction facilities could constrain the amount of LNG available for shipping, reducing ship
utilization. The rate of growth of the LNG industry has fluctuated due to several factors, including the
rate of global economic growth, fluctuations in global commodity prices, including natural gas, oil and
coal as well as other sources of energy, and energy and environmental policy in markets which produce
and/or consume LNG. Continued growth in LNG production and demand for LNG and LNG shipping
could be negatively affected by a number of factors, including:

-  prices for crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas. Currently extremely low natural gas prices
globally may limit the willingness and ability of developers of new LNG infrastructure projects to
approve the development of such new projects;

-  the cost of natural gas derived from LNG relative to the cost of natural gas generally and to the
cost of alternative fuels, including renewables, and the impact of increases in the cost of natural
gas derived from LNG on consumption of LNG;

-  increases in the production levels of lower cost natural gas in domestic natural gas consuming
markets, which could further depress prices for natural gas in those markets and make LNG
uneconomical;

-  increases in the production of natural gas in areas linked by pipelines to consuming areas, or the
extension of existing pipelines, or the development of new pipeline systems in markets we may
serve;

-  infrastructure constraints such as delays in the construction of liquefaction facilities or
regasification facilities, the inability of project owners or operators to obtain governmental
approvals to construct or operate LNG facilities, as well as community or political action group
resistance to new LNG infrastructure due to concerns about the environment, safety and
terrorism;

-  concerns regarding the spread of disease, for example, the COVID-19 virus, safety and
terrorism;

-  changes in weather patterns leading to warmer winters in the northern hemisphere and lower
gas demand in the traditional peak heating season;

-  the availability and allocation of capital by developers to new LNG projects, especially the major
oil and gas companies and other leading participants in the LNG industry;

-  increases in interest rates, capital market volatility, changes in bank regulations or other events
that may affect the availability of sufficient financing for LNG projects on commercially
reasonable terms;

-  negative global or regional economic or political conditions, particularly in LNG consuming
regions which could reduce energy consumption or its growth;

-  new taxes or regulations affecting LNG production or liquefaction that make LNG production
less attractive;

19


-----

-  labor or political unrest or military conflicts affecting existing or proposed areas of LNG
production, regasification or consumption;

-  any significant explosion, spill or other incident involving an LNG facility or carrier; or

-  regional, national or international energy policies that constrain the production or consumption
of hydrocarbons including natural gas.

In recent years, global natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile. Any decline in oil prices
can depress natural gas prices and lead to a narrowing of the difference in pricing between geographic
regions, which can adversely affect the length of voyages in the spot LNG shipping market and the spot
rates and medium-term charter rates for charters which commence in the near future.

**_A continuation of the recent low prices in natural gas and volatile oil prices may adversely affect our growth_**
**_prospects, results of operations and cash flows._**

Natural gas prices are volatile and have recently reached their lowest levels since 2009 in certain
geographic areas. Natural gas prices are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including but
not limited to the following:

-  price and availability of crude oil, petroleum products and coal;

-  worldwide and regional supply of, demand for and price of natural gas;

-  the cost of exploration, development, production, transportation and distribution of natural gas;

-  expectations regarding future energy prices for both natural gas and other sources of energy,
including renewable energy sources and coal;

-  the level of worldwide LNG production and exports;

-  government laws and regulations, including but not limited to environmental protection laws and
regulations;

-  local and international political, economic and weather conditions;

-  political and military conflicts; and

-  the availability and cost of alternative energy sources, including coal and alternate sources of
natural gas in gas importing and consuming countries.

Given the significant global natural gas and crude oil price volatility referenced above, and with
eight vessels currently scheduled to come off charter during 2020 and 2021, a continuation of current
low natural gas or oil prices may adversely affect our future business, results of operations and financial
condition and our ability to pay cash dividends, as a result of, among other things:

-  a reduction in exploration for or development of new natural gas reserves or projects, or the
delay or cancellation of existing projects as energy companies lower their capital expenditures
budgets, which may reduce our growth opportunities;

-  low oil prices negatively affecting the market price of natural gas, to the extent that natural gas
prices are benchmarked to the price of crude oil, in turn negatively affecting the economics of
potential new LNG production projects, which may reduce our growth opportunities;

-  high oil prices negatively affecting the competitiveness of natural gas to the extent that natural
gas prices are linked to the price of crude oil;

-  low gas prices globally and/or weak differentials between prices in the Atlantic Basin and the
Pacific Basin leading to reduced inter-basin trading of LNG and reduced demand for LNG
shipping;

20


-----

-  lower demand for vessels of the types we own and operate, which may reduce available charter
rates and revenue to us upon redeployment of our vessels following expiration or termination of
existing contracts or upon the initial chartering of vessels;

-  customers potentially seeking to renegotiate or terminate existing vessel contracts, or failing to
extend or renew contracts upon expiration;

-  the inability or refusal of customers to make charter payments to us due to financial constraints
or otherwise; or

-  declines in vessel values, which may result in losses to us upon vessel sales or impairment
charges against our earnings and could impact compliance with covenants in loan
documentation.

**_Changes in global and regional economic conditions and capital markets volatility could adversely impact our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

Weak global or regional economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our
shareholders in ways that we cannot predict. Our ability to expand our fleet beyond our contracted
newbuildings will be dependent on our ability to obtain financing to fund the acquisition of additional
ships. In addition, uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause our
customers to defer projects in response to tighter credit, decreased capital availability and declining
customer confidence, may negatively impact the demand for our ships and services and could also
result in defaults under our current charters. Global financial markets and economic conditions have
been volatile in recent years and remain subject to significant vulnerabilities. A further tightening of the
credit markets may negatively impact our operations by affecting the solvency of our suppliers or
customers, which could lead to disruptions in delivery of supplies such as equipment for conversions,
cost increases for supplies, accelerated payments to suppliers, customer bad debts or reduced revenues.
Similarly, such market conditions could affect lenders participating in our financing agreements, making
them unable to fulfill their commitments and obligations to us. Any reductions in activity owing to such
conditions or failure by our customers, suppliers or lenders to meet their contractual obligations to us
could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including
cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

GasLog LNG Services, our vessels’ management company, and a substantial number of its staff,
including members of our Senior Management, are located in Greece. A return of economic instability
in Greece could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. We have sought to
minimize this risk and preserve operational stability by carefully developing staff deployment plans, an
information technology recovery site, an alternative ship-to-shore communications plan and funding
mechanisms outside of Greece. While we believe these plans, combined with the international nature of
our operations, will mitigate the impact of any disruption of operations in Greece, we cannot assure
you that these plans will be effective in all circumstances.

GasLog has an office in England and our vessels may visit ports within the United Kingdom. The
United Kingdom exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 and entered a transition period from
February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 during which it will seek to agree to the terms of its future
relationship with the European Union. Uncertainty regarding the relationship between the United
Kingdom and the European Union post 2020 may create economic instability in the United Kingdom
which could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. Whilst we will seek to
minimize any potential risk by putting appropriate mitigation plans in place, we cannot assure you that
these plans will be effective in all circumstances.

**_Compliance with safety and other requirements imposed by classification societies may be very costly and may_**
**_adversely affect our business._**

The hull and machinery of every commercial LNG carrier must be certified by a classification
society. The classification society certifies that the ship has been built and subsequently maintained in
accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of that classification society. Moreover, every ship
must comply with all applicable international conventions and the regulations of the ship’s flag state as
verified by a classification society. Finally, each ship must successfully undergo periodic surveys,
including annual, intermediate and special surveys performed under the classification society’s rules.

If any ship does not maintain its class, it will lose its insurance coverage and be unable to trade,
and the ship’s owner will be in breach of relevant covenants under its financing arrangements and
potentially its charter contracts. Failure to maintain the class of one or more of our ships could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows,
including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

**_Climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions may adversely impact our operations and markets._**

Due to concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries and the IMO, have
adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emission
from ships. These regulatory measures may include the adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon
taxes, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Although
emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping currently are not subject to agreements
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, such as the ‘‘Kyoto Protocol’’
and the ‘‘Paris Agreement’’, a new treaty may be adopted in the future that includes additional
restrictions on shipping emissions to those already adopted under the International Convention for the
Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships, or the ‘‘MARPOL Convention’’. Compliance with future
changes in laws and regulations relating to climate change could increase the costs of operating and
maintaining our ships and could require us to install new emission controls, as well as acquire
allowances, pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions or administer and manage a greenhouse
gas emissions program. Revenue generation and strategic growth opportunities may also be adversely
affected.

There is increasing focus on the environmental footprint of the energy and transportation sectors
from governments, regulators, shareholders, customers, environmental pressure groups and other
stakeholders. This has been manifested recently by Shell’s commitment to base executive remuneration
in part on the achievement of specific carbon emissions targets, covering all of its activities and
products and those of its suppliers. GasLog’s vessels on charter to Shell and other energy companies
form part of their supply chain and are likely to be captured within these targets. In addition, many
large financial institutions are under pressure both to reduce their own environmental footprints and to
monitor the environmental footprints of the companies and projects to which they lend. While LNG is
among the cleanest marine transportation fuels, and while there are no legally binding obligations on
GasLog or its peers to reduce emissions today, the focus and pressure on the environmental footprint
of the marine transportation sector is likely to remain high and may increase. Any specific
requirements imposed on GasLog by regulators, governments, customers or other stakeholders may
impact the useful life of our vessels, increase our operating costs or require us to undertake significant
investments in our vessels which may reduce our revenues, profits and cash flows and may impact our
ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.

Adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry relating to climate change, including growing public
concern about the environmental impact of climate change, may also have an effect on demand for our
services. For example, increased regulation of greenhouse gases or other concerns relating to climate
change may reduce the demand for oil and natural gas in the future or create greater incentives for use

of alternative energy sources. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could
have significant and unpredictable financial and operational adverse impacts on our business.

**_We operate our ships worldwide, which could expose us to political, governmental and economic instability_**
**_that could harm our business._**

Because we operate our ships in the geographic areas where our customers do business, our
operations may be affected by political, governmental and economic conditions in the countries where
our ships operate or where they are registered. Any disruption caused by these factors could harm our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for payment
of dividends to shareholders. In particular, our ships frequent LNG terminals in countries including
Egypt, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea and Trinidad, as well as transit through the Gulf of Aden and the
Strait of Hormuz. Future hostilities or other political instability in the geographic regions where we
operate or may operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for payment of dividends to shareholders.
General trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalated in 2018, with three rounds of U.S. tariffs
on Chinese goods taking effect in July, August and September 2018 and a further round taking effect
in September 2019, each followed by a round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. Our business
could be harmed by these tariffs, as well as any trade embargoes or other economic sanctions by the
United States or other countries against countries in the Middle East, Asia, Russia or elsewhere as a
result of terrorist attacks, hostilities or diplomatic or political pressures that limit trading activities with
those countries.

**_Failure to control the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting the global economy, energy_**
**_demand and our business._**

The recent COVID-19 virus outbreak has introduced uncertainty in a number of areas of our
business, including our operational, commercial and financial activities. It has also negatively impacted,
and may continue to impact negatively, global economic activity, demand for energy including LNG,
particularly in China, and funds flows and sentiment in the global financial markets. Our share price
has recently declined significantly, due in part to the impact of the COVID-19 virus. The ongoing
spread of the COVID-19 virus may continue to negatively affect our business, our operations, including
our newbuildings under construction in South Korea, and our financial position and prospects. Failure
to control the continued spread of the virus could significantly impact economic activity, demand for
LNG and LNG shipping which could further negatively affect our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash available for payment of dividends to shareholders.

**_Terrorist attacks, international hostilities, political change and piracy could adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

Terrorist attacks, piracy and the current conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as
other current and future conflicts and political change, may adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our
shareholders. The continuing hostilities in the Middle East may lead to additional acts of terrorism,
further regional conflicts, other armed actions around the world and civil disturbance in the United
States or elsewhere, which may contribute to further instability in the global financial markets. These
uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable
to us, or at all.

In the past, political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on ships, mining of waterways and other
efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. Acts of terrorism and
piracy have also affected ships trading in regions such as the South China Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
Any terrorist attacks targeted at ships may in the future have a material negative affect on our

23


-----

business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could directly impact our ships or
our customers.

We currently employ armed guards onboard certain vessels operating in areas that may be prone
to hijacking or terrorist attacks. The presence of armed guards may increase the risk of damage, injury
or loss of life in connection with any attacks on our vessels, in addition to increasing crew costs.

We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from acts of terrorism, piracy, regional conflicts
and other armed actions, including losses relating to the employment of armed guards.

LNG facilities, shipyards, ships, pipelines and gas fields could be targets of future terrorist attacks
or piracy. Any such attacks could lead to, among other things, bodily injury or loss of life, as well as
damage to the ships or other property, increased ship operating costs, including insurance costs,
reductions in the supply of LNG and the inability to transport LNG to or from certain locations.
Terrorist attacks, war or other events beyond our control that adversely affect the production, storage
or transportation of LNG to be shipped by us could entitle our customers to terminate our charter
contracts in certain circumstances, which would harm our cash flows and our business.

Terrorist attacks, or the perception that LNG facilities and LNG carriers are potential terrorist
targets, could materially and adversely affect expansion of LNG infrastructure and the continued supply
of LNG. Concern that LNG facilities may be targeted for attack by terrorists has contributed
significantly to local community and environmental group resistance to the construction of a number of
LNG facilities, primarily in North America. If a terrorist incident involving an LNG facility or LNG
carrier did occur, in addition to the possible effects identified in the previous paragraph, the incident
may adversely affect the construction of additional LNG facilities and could lead to the temporary or
permanent closing of various LNG facilities currently in operation.

**_In the future, the ships we own or manage could be required to call at ports located in countries that are_**
**_subject to restrictions imposed by the United States and other governments._**

The United States and other governments and their agencies impose sanctions and embargoes on
certain countries and maintain lists of countries they consider to be state sponsors of terrorism. For
example, in 2010, the United States enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and
Divestment Act, or ‘‘CISADA’’, which expanded the scope of the former Iran Sanctions Act. Among
other things, CISADA expanded the application of the prohibitions imposed by the U.S. government to
non-U.S. companies, such as GasLog, and limits the ability of companies and persons to do business or
trade with Iran when such activities relate to the investment, supply or export of refined petroleum or
petroleum products, as well as LNG.

In 2012, President Obama signed Executive Order 13608, which prohibits foreign persons from
violating, or attempting to violate, or causing a violation of, any sanctions in effect against Iran, or
facilitating any deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to U.S. sanctions. The
Secretary of the Treasury may prohibit any transactions or dealings, including any U.S. capital markets
financing, involving any person found to be in violation of Executive Order 13608. Also in 2012, the
U.S. enacted the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or the ‘‘ITRA’’, which
created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions. Among other things, the ITRA intensifies
existing sanctions regarding the provision of goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Iran’s
petroleum or petrochemical sector. The ITRA also includes a provision requiring the President of the
United States to impose five or more sanctions from Section 6(a) of the Iran Sanctions Act, as
amended, on a person the President determines is a controlling beneficial owner of, or otherwise owns,
operates, or controls or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another
country and (1) if the person is a controlling beneficial owner of the vessel, the person had actual
knowledge the vessel was so used or (2) if the person otherwise owns, operates, or controls, or insures
the vessel, the person knew or should have known the vessel was so used. Such a person could be

24


-----

subject to a variety of sanctions, including exclusion from U.S. capital markets, exclusion from financial
transactions subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and exclusion of such person’s vessels from U.S. ports for up to
two years. The ITRA also includes a requirement that issuers of securities must disclose to the SEC in
their annual and quarterly reports filed after February 6, 2013 whether the issuer or ‘‘any affiliate’’ has
‘‘knowingly’’ engaged in certain sanctioned activities involving Iran during the timeframe covered by the
report. Finally, in January 2013, the U.S. enacted the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of
2012 or the ‘‘IFCA’’, which expanded the scope of U.S. sanctions on any person that is part of Iran’s
energy, shipping or shipbuilding sector and operators of ports in Iran, and imposes penalties on any
person who facilitates or otherwise knowingly provides significant financial, material or other support to
these entities.

On January 16, 2016, the United States suspended certain sanctions against Iran applicable to
non-U.S. companies, such as us, pursuant to the nuclear agreement reached between Iran, China,
France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union. To
implement these changes, beginning on January 16, 2016, the United States waived enforcement of
many of the sanctions against Iran’s energy and petrochemical sectors described above, among other
things, including certain provisions of CISADA, ITRA, and IFCA. In May 2018, President Trump
announced the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and almost all the
U.S. sanctions waived and lifted in January 2016 were reinstated in August 2018 and November 2018,
respectively.

Although the ships we own have not called on ports in countries subject to sanctions or embargoes
or in countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, North Korea and Syria, we can
give no assurance that these ships will not call on ports in these countries in the future. While we
intend to maintain compliance with all sanctions and embargoes applicable to us, U.S. and international
sanctions and embargo laws and regulations do not necessarily apply to the same countries or proscribe
the same activities, which may make compliance difficult. Additionally, the scope of certain laws may be
unclear, and these laws may be subject to changing interpretations and application and may be
amended or strengthened from time to time, including by adding or removing countries from the
proscribed lists. Violations of sanctions and embargo laws and regulations could result in fines or other
penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their investment, or
not to invest, in us.

**_Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-bribery_**
**_legislation in other jurisdictions could result in fines, criminal penalties, contract terminations and an adverse_**
**_effect on our business._**

We operate our ships worldwide, requiring our ships to trade in countries known to have a
reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable
anti-corruption laws and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which is consistently
applied and in full compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the ‘‘FCPA’’,
and the Bribery Act 2010 of the United Kingdom or the ‘‘UK Bribery Act’’. We are subject, however,
to the risk that we, our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents may take actions determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA
and the UK Bribery Act. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or
criminal penalties, or curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends
to our shareholders. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to
do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive
and can consume significant senior management time and attention.

25

**_Changing laws and evolving reporting requirements could have an adverse effect on our business._**

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to reporting requirements may create additional
compliance requirements for us. To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public
disclosure, GasLog has invested in, and intends to continue to invest in, reasonably necessary resources
to comply with evolving standards.

The European Union Code of Conduct Group has assessed the tax policies of a range of countries
including Bermuda, where our vessel owning entities are incorporated. Bermuda was included in a list
of jurisdictions which are required to address the European Union Code of Conduct Group’s concerns
in respect of ‘economic substance’. Bermuda, along with the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands,
Guernsey, Bailiwick of Jersey and the Isle of Man, has committed to comply with the European Union
Code of Conduct Group’s requirements on economic substance and has passed legislation in the form
of the Economic Substance Act 2018 (the ‘‘ESA’’). Currently, there is uncertainty surrounding the
interpretation of the ESA and the relevant regulations as the Bermuda government, along with the
respective governments of the other jurisdictions referenced above, remain in discussions with the
European Union Code of Conduct Group.

At present, the impact of these new economic substance requirements seems clear, and GasLog
has filed the required returns confirming we have appropriate economic substance in Bermuda.
However, it is not possible to accurately predict the outcome of any review by the authorities as to
whether or not GasLog and its business has accurately interpreted the requirements. Whilst we believe
we have taken appropriate advice and counsel from the relevant authorities and external legal advisors,
the requirements may increase the complexity and costs of carrying on GasLog’s business with entities
incorporated in Bermuda.

**_Our insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our property or result from our_**
**_operations which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows._**

The operation of any ship includes risks such as mechanical failure, personal injury, collision, fire,
contact with floating objects, property loss or damage, cargo loss or damage and business interruption
due to a number of reasons, including political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities and labor
strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of a marine disaster, including collision,
explosion, spills and other environmental mishaps, and other liabilities arising from owning, operating
or managing ships in international trade. Although we carry protection and indemnity, hull and
machinery, loss of hire and cyber risk insurance covering our ships consistent with industry standards,
we can give no assurance that we are adequately insured against all risks or that our insurers will pay a
particular claim. In addition, we may be unable to insure against certain cyber events that may disrupt
our information and operational technology systems. We also may be unable to procure adequate
insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future. Even if our insurance coverage is
adequate to cover our losses, we may not be able to obtain a timely replacement ship in the event of a
loss of a ship. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to shareholders.

In addition, some of our insurance coverage is maintained through mutual protection and
indemnity associations, and, as a member of such associations, we may be required to make additional
payments over and above budgeted premiums if member claims exceed association reserves.

**_Reliability of suppliers may limit our ability to obtain supplies and services when needed._**

We rely, and will in the future rely, on a significant supply of consumables, spare parts and
equipment to operate, maintain, repair and upgrade our fleet of ships. Delays in delivery or
unavailability of supplies could result in off-hire days due to consequent delays in the repair and
maintenance of our fleet. This would negatively impact our revenues and cash flows. Cost increases

26


-----

could also negatively impact our future operations, although the impact of significant cost increases
may be mitigated to some extent with respect to the vessels that are employed under charter contracts
with automatic periodic adjustment provisions or cost review provisions.

**_Governments could requisition our ships during a period of war or emergency, resulting in loss of earnings._**

The government of a jurisdiction where one or more of our ships are registered could requisition
for title or seize our ships. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a ship and
becomes its owner. Also, a government could requisition our ships for hire. Requisition for hire occurs
when a government takes control of a ship and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter
rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency, although governments may
elect to requisition ships in other circumstances. Although we would expect to be entitled to
government compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our ships, the amount and
timing of payments, if any, would be uncertain. A government requisition of one or more of our ships
would result in off-hire days under our time charters, may cause us to breach covenants in certain of
our credit facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

**_Maritime claimants could arrest our ships, which could interrupt our cash flows._**

Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a ship, shippers or receivers of cargo and other
parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a ship for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In
many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by arresting a ship. The arrest or
attachment of one or more of our ships which is not timely discharged could cause us to default on a
charter or breach covenants in certain of our credit facilities and, to the extent such arrest or
attachment is not covered by our protection and indemnity insurance, could require us to pay large
sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted. Any of these occurrences could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash
available for dividends to our shareholders.

Additionally, in some jurisdictions, such as the Republic of South Africa, under the ‘‘sister ship’’
theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the ship that is subject to the claimant’s maritime lien
and any ‘‘associated’’ ship, which is any ship owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could
try to assert ‘‘sister ship’’ liability against one ship in our fleet for claims relating to another of our
ships.

**_We may be subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on us._**

We may in the future be involved from time to time in litigation matters. These matters may
include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or
proceedings, toxic tort claims, employment matters and governmental claims for taxes or duties, as well
as other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty
the outcome of any claim or other litigation matter. The ultimate outcome of any litigation matter and
the potential costs associated with prosecuting or defending such lawsuits, including the diversion of
management’s attention to these matters, could have an adverse effect on us and, in the event of
litigation that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on us, could lead to an
event of default under certain of our credit facilities.

**Risks Inherent in an Investment in GasLog**

**_Due to our lack of diversification, adverse developments in the LNG market and/or in the LNG transportation_**
**_industry could adversely affect our business, particularly if such developments occur at a time when we are_**
**_seeking new charters for our vessels._**

We rely exclusively on the cash flow generated from charters for our LNG vessels and
management of third party LNG vessels. Due to our lack of diversification, an adverse development in
the LNG market and/or the LNG transportation industry could have a significantly greater impact on
our business, particularly if such developments occur at a time when our ships are not under charter or
nearing the end of their charters, than if we maintained more diverse assets or lines of businesses.

**_Our contracts for the seven newbuildings we have on order as of March 2, 2020 are subject to risks that could_**
**_cause delays in the delivery of the ships, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows._**

Our seven contracted newbuildings are scheduled to be delivered to us on various dates between
2020 and 2021. Significant delays in the delivery of one or more of these ships, which are expected to
generate a substantial portion of our contracted revenue in future years, would delay our receipt of
revenues under the related time charters. For prolonged delays, the customer may terminate the
charter and, in addition to the resulting loss of revenues, we may be responsible for additional
substantial liquidated damages, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, the
delivery of any of these ships with substantial defects or unexpected operational problems could have
similar consequences.

The completion and delivery of newbuildings or conversions could be delayed because of:

-  quality or engineering problems;

-  changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organization standards;

-  work stoppages or other labor disturbances at the shipyard;

-  bankruptcy or other financial crisis of the shipbuilder;

-  a backlog of orders at the shipyard;

-  political or economic disturbances;

-  weather interference or a catastrophic event, such as a major earthquake or fire;

-  accidents, diseases or pandemics, including the COVID-19 virus;

-  requests for changes to the original vessel specifications;

-  shortages of or delays in the receipt of necessary construction materials, such as steel;

-  the inability to finance the construction or conversion of the vessels; or

-  the inability to obtain requisite permits or approvals.

If delivery of a vessel is materially delayed, it could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our
shareholders.

28


-----

**_As we take delivery of our newbuildings or any secondhand ships we acquire in the future, we will need to_**
**_expand our staff and crew. If we cannot recruit and retain employees and provide adequate compensation, our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected._**

Our ability to acquire and retain customers depends on a number of factors, including our ability
to staff our vessels with masters, officers and crews of suitable experience in operating LNG carriers.
As we take delivery of our newbuildings or any secondhand ships we acquire in the future, we expect to
hire a significant number of seafarers qualified to staff and operate our new vessels, as well as
additional shoreside personnel. As the global LNG carrier fleet continues to grow, we expect the
demand for technically skilled and experienced officers and crew to increase. This could lead to an
industry-wide shortfall of qualified personnel, resulting in increased crew costs, which could constrain
our ability to recruit suitable employees to operate our LNG carriers within our budget parameters.

Material increases in crew costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, if we
cannot recruit and retain sufficient numbers of quality on-board seafaring personnel, we may not be
able to fully utilize our expanded fleet, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our
shareholders.

**_We may have difficulty further expanding our fleet in the future._**

We may expand our fleet beyond our contracted newbuildings by ordering additional newbuildings
or by making selective acquisitions of high-quality secondhand vessels to the extent that they are
available in the same way that we acquired the GasLog Chelsea and the eight vessels acquired from
MSL in 2014 and 2015. Our future growth will depend on numerous factors, some of which are beyond
our control, including our ability to:

-  identify attractive ship acquisition opportunities and consummate such acquisitions;

-  obtain newbuilding contracts at acceptable prices;

-  obtain required equity and debt financing on acceptable terms;

-  secure charter arrangements on terms acceptable to us and to our lenders;

-  recruit and retain additional suitably qualified and experienced seafarers and shore-based
employees;

-  continue to meet technical and safety performance standards;

-  manage joint ventures; and

-  manage the expansion of our operations to integrate the new ships into our fleet.

We may not be successful in executing any future growth plans, and we cannot give any assurances
that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with such growth efforts.

**_Our credit facilities are secured by our ships and contain payment obligations and restrictive covenants that_**
**_may restrict our business and financing activities as well as our ability to pay dividends. A failure by us to_**
**_meet our obligations under our credit facilities could result in an event of default under such credit facilities_**
**_and foreclosure on our ships._**

Our credit facilities impose, and any future credit facility we enter into will impose, operating and
financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions in our credit facilities generally limit
our shipowning subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

-  incur additional indebtedness, create liens or provide guarantees;

29


-----

-  provide any form of credit or financial assistance to, or enter into any non-arms’ length
transactions with, us or any of our affiliates;

-  sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including our ships;

-  engage in merger transactions;

-  terminate any charter;

-  amend our shipbuilding contracts;

-  change the manager of our ships;

-  undergo a change in ownership; or

-  acquire assets, make investments or enter into any joint venture arrangements outside of the
ordinary course of business.

Our credit facilities also impose certain restrictions relating to us and our other subsidiaries,
including restrictions that limit our ability to make any substantial change in the nature of our business
or to engage in transactions that would constitute a change of control, as defined in the relevant credit
facility, without repaying all of our indebtedness in part or in full.

Our credit facilities also impose specified financial covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis to GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial
covenants generally include the following:

-  net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0
(not included in the GasLog Partners financial covenants);

-  total indebtedness divided by our total assets must not exceed 75.0% (in the case of the GasLog
Partners financial covenants, must be less than 65.0%);

-  the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments must be at least
$75.0 million (in the case of the GasLog Partners financial covenants, the aggregate amount of
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and available undrawn facilities with
remaining maturities of at least six months (excluding loans from affiliates) must be at least
$45.0 million);

-  the ratio of EBITDA over our debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments)
on a trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%. The ratio shall be regarded as
having been complied with even if the ratio falls below the stipulated 110% when cash and cash
equivalent and short-term investments are at least $110.0 million (not included in the GasLog
Partners financial covenants);

-  being permitted to pay dividends subject to no event of default having occurred or occurring as
a consequence of the payment of such dividends (in the case of the GasLog Partners financial
covenants, being permitted to pay dividends subject to no event of default having occurred or
resulting from such payment); and

-  market value adjusted net worth must be not less than $350.0 million (not included in the
GasLog Partners financial covenants).

In addition, our credit facilities contain covenants requiring us and certain of our subsidiaries to
maintain the aggregate of (i) the market value, on a charter exclusive basis, of the mortgaged vessel or
vessels and (ii) the market value of any additional security provided to the lenders, at a value of not
less than 120.0% (in the case of the October 2015 Facility and the 7xNB Facility, 115.0% for the first
two years after each drawdown and 120.0% at any time thereafter) of the then outstanding amount
under the applicable facility. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are not able to obtain

30


-----

covenant waivers or modifications, our lenders could require us to make prepayments or provide
additional collateral sufficient to bring us into compliance with such covenants and, if we fail to do so,
our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.

Further, GasLog has issued the NOK 2024 Bonds and the US dollar denominated 8.875% Senior
Notes which also impose specified financial covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. Under the terms of the NOK 2024 Bonds, GasLog is required to comply with the
following financial covenants:

-  net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0;

-  total indebtedness divided by total assets must not exceed 75.0%;

-  the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments must be at least
$75.0 million;

-  the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a
trailing 12 months basis must be not less than 110.0%.The ratio shall be regarded as having been
complied with even if the ratio falls below the stipulated 110% when cash and cash equivalent
and short-term investments are at least $110.0 million; and

-  GasLog’s market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.

In addition, the terms of the NOK 2024 Bonds include a dividend restriction according to which
GasLog may not (i) declare or make any dividend payment or distribution, whether in cash or in kind,
(ii) re-purchase any of GasLog’s shares or undertake other similar transactions (including, but not
limited to, total return swaps related to GasLog’s shares), or (iii) grant any loans or make other
distributions or transactions constituting a transfer of value to GasLog’s shareholders (items (i), (ii) and
(iii) collectively referred to as the ‘‘Distributions’’) that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year
$1.10/share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GasLog may make any amount of Distributions, so long as
the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed $150.0 million, provided that
GasLog can demonstrate by delivering a compliance certificate to the bond trustee that no event of
default is continuing or would result from such Distributions.Under the terms of the 8.875% Senior
Notes, GasLog is required to comply with the following financial covenants:

-  net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0;

-  total indebtedness divided by total indebtedness plus total equity must not exceed 75.0%;

-  the ratio of EBITDA over debt service, on a trailing four quarter basis, shall be not less than
100.0%;

-  the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the
higher of 2.50% of total indebtedness or $35.0 million; and

-  the issuer’s market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $300.0 million.

Our ability to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in our financing arrangements may
be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry
conditions. A failure to comply with covenants and restrictions or to meet our payment and other
obligations could lead to defaults under our credit facilities which could cause our payment obligations
to be accelerated. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated
payments. Because obligations under our financing arrangements are secured by our ships and are
guaranteed by our ship-owning subsidiaries, if we are unable to repay debt under our financing
arrangements, the lenders could seek to foreclose on those assets, which would materially and adversely
impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available
for dividends to our shareholders. In addition, a default under one of our credit facilities could result

31


-----

in the cross-acceleration of our other indebtedness. For more information regarding our credit facilities,
please read ‘‘Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Credit Facilities’’.

The significant global natural gas and crude oil price volatility, amongst other factors referenced
above, have in turn led to a significant shortening of the average duration of spot charters fixed during
2019, as well as a significant decline in average rates for new spot and shorter-term LNG charters
commencing promptly. Unless LNG charter market conditions improve, we may have difficulty in
securing new charters at attractive rates and durations for the six vessels in the spot market. As of
December 31, 2019, we had a total of 2,611 open vessel days during 2020. A failure to obtain charters
at acceptable rates on these vessels could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our shareholders.

**_Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing, pursuing other business_**
**_opportunities and paying dividends to our shareholders._**

As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $3.1 billion of indebtedness outstanding under
our credit agreements, the NOK 2021 Bonds, the NOK 2024 Bonds and the 8.875% Senior Notes, of
which $255.4 million was repayable within one year, and finance lease liabilities of $204.9 million, of
which $9.4 million was repayable within one year. As of December 31, 2019, there was an undrawn
available capacity of $100.0 million under the revolving facility of the Legacy Facility Refinancing and
$2.0 million under the 2019 Partnership Facility. In addition, there is $1.1 billion available under the
7xNB Facility to finance a portion of the contract price of our seven newbuildings delivering in 2020
and 2021. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future as we grow our fleet. This level of debt
could have important consequences to us, including the following:

-  our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures,
ship acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on
favorable terms;

-  we will need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on
our debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business
opportunities and dividends to our shareholders;

-  the requirement on us to maintain minimum levels of liquidity as a percentage of our total debt,
reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business
opportunities and dividends to our shareholders;

-  our costs of borrowing could increase as we become more leveraged;

-  our debt level may make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive
pressures or a downturn in our industry or the economy generally;

-  our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic
conditions; and

-  if we are unable to satisfy the restrictions included in any of our financing agreements or are
otherwise in default under any of those agreements, as a result of our debt levels or otherwise,
we will not be able to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.

Our ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our future financial and
operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business,
regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not
sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as
reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling

32


-----

assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy
protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms, or at all.

**_Our ability to pay dividends or to redeem our Preference Shares may be limited by the amount of cash we_**
**_generate from operations, by restrictions in our credit facilities and by additional factors unrelated to our_**
**_profitability._**

We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends. The declaration and payment of any dividend
(including cumulative dividends payable with respect to our Preference Shares) is subject to the
discretion of our board of directors and the requirements of Bermuda law. The timing and amount of
any dividend or redemption payments will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, cash
requirements and availability, restrictions in our debt agreements, the provisions of Bermuda law and
other factors. The amount of cash we generate from operations and the actual amount of cash we will
have available for dividends or to redeem our Preference Shares will vary based upon, among other
things:

-  general LNG shipping market conditions and trends, including charter rates, ship values, factors
affecting supply and demand, technological advancements and opportunities for the profitable
operations of LNG carriers;

-  our ability to comply with the specified financial covenants in our loan facilities, NOK 2024
Bonds and 8.875% Senior Notes and as corporate guarantor for certain loan facilities on a
consolidated basis;

-  our ability to obtain new charters for our vessels at acceptable rates;

-  the charter hire payments we obtain from our charters as well as our ability to re-charter the
vessels and the rates obtained upon the expiration of our existing charters;

-  our fleet expansion and associated uses of our cash as well as any financing requirements;

-  the due performance by our charterers of their obligations;

-  delays in the delivery of newbuild vessels and the beginning of payments under charters relating
to those vessels;

-  the level of our operating costs, such as the costs of crews, lubricants and insurance, as well as
the costs of repairs, maintenance or modifications of our ships;

-  the number of unscheduled off-hire days for our fleet and the timing of, and number of days
required for, scheduled dry-docking of our ships;

-  our ability to obtain financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate
activities, funding by banks of their financial commitments, and our ability to meet our
obligations under our credit facilities;

-  prevailing global and regional economic or political conditions;

-  changes in interest rates;

-  the effect of governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards on
the conduct of our business;

-  changes in the basis of taxation of our activities in various jurisdictions;

-  modification or revocation of our dividend policy by our board of directors; and

-  the amount of any cash reserves established by our board of directors.

33


-----

For information regarding the dividend payment restrictions in our financing agreements, see
‘‘—Risks Inherent in an Investment in GasLog—Our credit facilities are secured by our ships and
contain payment obligations and restrictive covenants that may restrict our business and financing
activities as well as our ability to pay dividends. A failure by us to meet our obligations under our
credit facilities could result in an event of default under such credit facilities and foreclosure on our
ships’’.

The amount of cash we generate from our operations may differ materially from our profit or loss
for the period, which will be affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities that
could reduce or eliminate the cash available for dividends.

Under Bermuda law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds
for believing that: (i) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they
become due; or (ii) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its
liabilities. Under our bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends as and when any such
dividends are declared by our board of directors. We may not declare a common dividend if the
payment of our preference dividends is in arrears.

As a result of these and the other factors mentioned above, we may pay dividends during periods
when we record losses and may not pay dividends during periods when we record a profit. We can give
no assurance that dividends will be paid in the future.

**_We are a holding company and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries, including GasLog Partners, to_**
**_distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments._**

We are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own all
of our operating assets, including our ships. As of March 2, 2020, we have no significant assets other
than the equity interests in our subsidiaries, including GasLog Partners, in which we hold a 35.6%%
equity interest (including our 2.0% general partner interest). As a result, our ability to pay our
obligations and to make dividend payments depends entirely on our subsidiaries and their ability to
distribute funds to us, including cash distributions and management and administrative services fees
received from GasLog Partners. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be
affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, or by the law of its jurisdiction
of incorporation which regulates the payment of dividends.

On February 6, 2020, in light of reduced expectations for steam vessel utilization and earnings,
GasLog Partners announced that it will focus its capital allocation on debt repayment, prioritizing
balance sheet strength for 2020. As such, the Partnership expects to reduce its quarterly common unit
distribution to $0.125 per unit for the first quarter of 2020 from $0.561 per unit for the fourth quarter
of 2019. Other factors which may impact the value of our equity interest in GasLog Partners and its
ability to distribute funds to us are described in its public filings with the SEC. If we are unable to
obtain funds from our subsidiaries, our board of directors may exercise its discretion not to declare or
pay dividends.

**_Fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates could result in financial losses for us._**

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on our financial
performance. We receive virtually all of our revenues in dollars, while some of our operating expenses,
including certain employee costs and crew costs, are denominated in euros and in British pounds. As a
result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk. However, we also maintain cash balances in euros and
British pounds, which amounted to approximately $8.0 million and $1.2 million as of December 31,
2019. We monitor exchange rate fluctuations on a continuous basis and we also hedge movements in
currency exchange rates. However, there is still a risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative

34


-----

effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available
for dividends to our shareholders.

**_Increased regulatory oversight, uncertainty relating to the nature and timing of the phasing out of LIBOR,_**
**_and agreement on any new alternative reference rates may adversely impact our ability to manage our_**
**_exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and borrowing costs._**

On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (‘‘FCA’’), which regulates
LIBOR, announced that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021.
There is therefore no guarantee the LIBOR reference rate will continue in its current form post 2021.
Various alternative reference rates are being considered in the financial community. The Secured
Overnight Financing Rate has been proposed by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a
committee convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve that includes major market participants and on which
regulators participate, as an alternative rate to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, it is not possible
at this time to know the ultimate impact a phase-out of LIBOR may have. The changes may adversely
affect the trading market for LIBOR based agreements, including our credit facilities, interest rate
swaps and Preference Units.

Further, if a LIBOR rate is not available on a determination date during the floating rate period
for any of our LIBOR based agreements, the terms of such agreements will require alternative
determination procedures which may result in interest or distribution payments differing from
expectations and could affect our profit and the market value of our Preference Units.

In addition, any changes announced by the FCA, including the FCA Announcement, the ICE
Benchmark Administration Limited (the independent administrator of LIBOR) or any other successor
governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to
which LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in
reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the level of interest or dividend payments during the
floating rate period for our LIBOR based agreements would be affected and could affect our profit or
the market value of our Preference Shares.

**_The derivative contracts used to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates could result in reductions_**
**_in our shareholders’ equity as well as charges in our statement of profit and loss._**

We enter into derivative contracts from time to time for purposes of managing our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates applicable to floating rate indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had
18 derivative contracts in place with a notional amount of $1.17 billion. The changes in the fair value of
the 18 derivative contracts that have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments are
recognized in our statement of profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative contracts that
do not qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges for financial reporting purposes would affect, among
other things, our profit, earnings per share and compliance with the market value adjusted net worth
covenants in our credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2019, we had three Cross Currency Swaps, or ‘‘CCSs’’, to exchange interest
payments and principal on maturity on the same terms as the NOK 2024 Bonds, in order to hedge the
variability of the functional currency equivalent cash flows on the NOK 2024 Bonds. As of
December 31, 2019, the three CCSs had a notional amount of $98.6 million and qualified as cash flow
hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of CCSs
is recognized in other comprehensive income while the ineffective portion impacts the statement of
profit or loss for the period.

We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts from time to time for purposes of managing our
exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates applicable to payments in foreign currencies (mainly
euros, British Pounds Sterling, Singapore dollars and Japanese Yen). As of December 31, 2019, we had

35


-----

43 forward foreign exchange contracts in place with an aggregate notional amount of A54.0 million, six
with an aggregate notional amount of £3.0 million, nine with a notional amount of S$4.5 million and
one with a notional amount of JP¥29.4 million. The changes in the fair value of these contracts that
have not been designated as cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in our statement of profit or
loss. Changes in the fair value of any derivative contracts that do not qualify for treatment as cash flow
hedges for financial reporting purposes would affect, among other things, our profit, earnings per share
and compliance with the market value adjusted net worth covenants in our credit facilities.

There is no assurance that our derivative contracts will provide adequate protection against
adverse changes in interest rates or that our bank counterparties will be able to perform their
obligations. In addition, as a result of the implementation of new regulation of the swaps markets in
the United States, the European Union and elsewhere over the next few years, the cost and availability
of interest rate and currency hedges may increase or suitable hedges may not be available.

**_Our earnings and business are subject to the credit risk associated with our contractual counterparties._**

We enter into, among other things, time charters and other contracts with our customers,
shipbuilding contracts and refund guarantees relating to newbuildings, credit facilities and commitment
letters with banks, insurance contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. Such
agreements subject us to counterparty credit risk. For example, the majority of our vessels are
chartered to, and we received the majority of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019
from, subsidiaries of Shell. We also have two vessels on charter to Trafigura, one vessel on charter to
Cheniere, two vessels on charter to Gunvor and six vessels trading in the spot market. While we believe
all our customers to be strong counterparties, their creditworthiness as assessed by independent parties
such as credit rating agencies is less strong than that of Shell. In the future, we may enter into new
charters with these and other counterparties who are less creditworthy.

The ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a
contract with us will depend upon a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include,
among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the natural gas and LNG markets
and charter hire rates. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us, we
could sustain significant losses which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends to our
shareholders.

**_Our business depends on certain of our senior executives who are subject to increasing demands as a result of_**
**_our growth and who may not necessarily continue to work for us._**

Increasing demands are placed on our management as a result of our growth. As we expand
operations, we must monitor our operations, control costs and maintain quality control. In addition, the
provision of management services to our publicly traded subsidiary, GasLog Partners, has increased the
complexity of our business and placed additional demands on our management. Our success depends to
a significant extent upon the abilities and the efforts of our Chairman, Peter G. Livanos, and certain of
our senior executives. Mr. Livanos has substantial experience in the shipping industry and has worked
with us for many years. He and certain of our senior executives are important to the execution of our
business strategies and to the growth and development of our business. If Mr. Livanos or one or more
of our senior executives ceased to be affiliated with us, we may be unable to recruit other employees
with equivalent talent and experience, and our business and financial condition could suffer.

**Risks Related to Our Securities**

**_The price of our common shares has recently declined significantly and may continue to be volatile._**

The price of our equity securities may be volatile and may fluctuate due to factors including:

-  our payment of dividends;

-  the amount of cash dividends paid to our shareholders;

-  repurchases by us of our common shares pursuant to our share repurchase programme;

-  actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly and annual results;

-  fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices;

-  fluctuations in the seaborne transportation industry, including fluctuations in the charter rates
and utilization of vessels in the LNG carrier market;

-  fluctuations in supply and demand for LNG;

-  mergers and strategic alliances in the shipping industry;

-  changes in governmental regulations or maritime self-regulatory organizations standards;

-  shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts;

-  announcements concerning us or our competitors;

-  the failure of securities analysts to publish research about us, or analysts making changes in their
financial estimates;

-  general economic conditions, including fluctuations in interest rates;

-  terrorist acts;

-  future sales of our shares or other securities;

-  investors’ perceptions of us, the LNG industry, the LNG shipping industry and the energy
industry more broadly;

-  the general state of the securities markets; and

-  other developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors, such as the recent outbreak of
the COVID-19 virus.

Securities markets worldwide are experiencing significant price and volume fluctuations. The
market price for our common shares may also be volatile. This market volatility, as well as general
economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common shares despite
our operating performance.

**_Increases in interest rates may cause the market price of our securities to decline._**

An increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments
in general. Any such increase in interest rates may result in a reduction in demand for our securities
resulting from other relatively more attractive investment opportunities and may cause the trading price
of our securities to decline.

**_We are a ‘‘foreign private issuer’’ under NYSE rules, and as such we are entitled to exemption from certain_**
**_NYSE corporate governance standards, and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of_**
**_companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements._**

We are a ‘‘foreign private issuer’’ under the securities laws of the United States and the rules of
the NYSE. Under the securities laws of the United States, ‘‘foreign private issuers’’ are subject to
different disclosure requirements than U.S. domiciled registrants, as well as different financial reporting
requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a ‘‘foreign private issuer’’ is subject to less stringent corporate
governance requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of the NYSE permit a ‘‘foreign
private issuer’’ to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of the NYSE,
including (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors,
(ii) the requirement that a nominating/corporate governance committee be established, (iii) the
requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors and have
a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and (iv) the requirement of
an annual performance evaluation of the compensation committee.

As permitted by these exemptions, as well as by our bye-laws and the laws of Bermuda, we have
one or more non-independent directors serving as committee members on our compensation
committee. As a result, non-independent directors may, among other things, participate in fixing the
compensation of our management, making share and option awards and resolving governance issues
regarding our Company.

Accordingly, in the future you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of
companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.

**_Substantial future sales of our equity securities could cause the market price of our equity securities to decline._**

Sales of a substantial number of our equity securities in the public market, or the perception that
these sales could occur, may depress the market price for our equity securities. These sales could also
impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities.

In the future we may issue additional equity securities which may be pari passu with or senior to
our common shares. The issuance by us of additional common shares or other equity securities that are
contractually or structurally pari passu with or senior to our common shares would have the following
effects:

-  our shareholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;

-  the dividend amount payable per share on our common shares may be lower;

-  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share may be diminished;
and

-  the market price of our common shares may decline.

Our shareholders also may elect to sell large numbers of equity securities held by them from time
to time. The number of our equity securities available for sale in the public market will be limited by
restrictions applicable under securities laws.

**_Our Preference Shares are subordinated to our debt obligations and investors’ interests could be diluted by the_**
**_issuance of additional preference shares and by other transactions._**

Our Preference Shares are subordinated to all of our existing and future indebtedness. As of
December 31, 2019, we had $3.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness. Our existing indebtedness
restricts, and our future indebtedness may include restrictions on, our ability to pay dividends to
shareholders. Our memorandum of association and bye-laws currently authorizes the issuance of an

38


-----

unlimited number of preference shares out of the 500,000,000 shares of share capital in one or more
classes or series. The issuance of additional preference shares on a parity with or senior to our
Preference Shares would dilute the interests of the holders of our Preference Shares, and any issuance
of preference shares senior to or at parity with our Preference Shares or of additional indebtedness
could affect our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on our
Preference Shares. No provisions relating to our Preference Shares protect the holders of our
Preference Shares in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction, including the sale, lease or
conveyance of all or substantially all our assets or business, which might adversely affect the holders of
our Preference Shares.

Our Preference Shares rank pari passu with any other class or series of shares established after the
original issue date of the Preference Shares that is not expressly subordinated or senior to the
Preference Shares as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable upon liquidation or
reorganization. If less than all dividends payable with respect to the Preference Shares and any parity
securities are paid, any partial payment shall be made pro rata with respect to shares of Preference
Shares and any parity securities entitled to a dividend payment at such time in proportion to the
aggregate amounts remaining due in respect of such shares at such time.

**_Holders of our Preference Shares have extremely limited voting rights._**

Our common shares are the only class of our shares carrying full voting rights. Holders of the
Preference Shares generally have no voting rights. However, if and whenever dividends payable on the
Preference Shares are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders
of Preference Shares (voting together as a class with all other classes or series of parity securities upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect one additional
director to serve on our board of directors, and the size of our board of directors will be increased as
needed to accommodate such change (unless the size of our board of directors already has been
increased by reason of the election of a director by holders of parity securities upon which like voting
rights have been conferred and with which the Preference Shares voted as a class for the election of
such director). The right of such holders of Preference Shares to elect a member of our board of
directors will continue until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Preference Shares have been
paid in full. In addition, holders of Preference Shares are entitled to vote together with holders of
common shares on matters related to the approval of an amalgamation or merger.

**_The Preference Shares represent perpetual equity interests and holders have no right to receive any greater_**
**_payment than the liquidation preference regardless of the circumstances._**

The Preference Shares represent perpetual equity interests in us and, unlike our indebtedness, will
not give rise to a claim for payment of a principal amount at a particular date. As a result, holders of
the Preference Shares may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Preference
Shares for an indefinite period of time. In addition, the Preference Shares rank junior in all our
indebtedness and other liabilities, and any other senior securities we may issue in the future with
respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us.

The payment due to a holder of Preference Shares upon a liquidation is fixed at the redemption
preference of $25.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to the date of liquidation. If, in
the case of our liquidation, there are remaining assets to be distributed after payment of this amount,
holders of Preference Shares will have no right to receive or to participate in these amounts.
Furthermore, if the market price for Preference Shares is greater than the liquidation preference,
holders of Preference Shares will have no right to receive the market price from us upon our
liquidation.

**_Entities controlled by members of the Livanos family are our principal shareholders and can effectively_**
**_control the outcome of most matters on which our shareholders are entitled to vote; their interests may be_**
**_different from yours._**

Entities controlled by members of the Livanos family, including our Chairman, may be deemed to
beneficially own approximately 40.7% of our issued and outstanding common shares. As a result of his
shareholding, Mr. Livanos can effectively control the outcome of most matters on which our
shareholders are entitled to vote, including the election of our entire board of directors and other
significant corporate actions. The interests of these shareholders may be different to yours.

**_Provisions in our organizational documents may have anti-takeover effects._**

Our bye-laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us
without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions require an affirmative vote of a
majority of the votes attaching to all issued and outstanding shares to approve any merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or similar transactions. Our bye-laws also provide for restrictions on the
time period in which directors may be nominated.

These provisions could make it difficult for our shareholders to replace or remove our current
board of directors or could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an offer by a third
party to acquire us, even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders.
As a result, shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.

**Tax Risks**

In addition to the following risk factors, you should read ‘‘Item 10. Additional Information—E. Tax
Considerations’’ for a more complete discussion of the material Bermuda and U.S. Federal income tax
considerations relating to us and the ownership and disposition of our common shares and Preference
Shares.

**_We may have to pay tax on U.S.-source income, which would reduce our earnings._**

Under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the ‘‘Code’’, the U.S.
source gross transportation income of a ship-owning or chartering corporation, such as ourselves, is
subject to a 4% U.S. Federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation
qualifies for exemption from tax under a tax treaty or Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. U.S. source gross transportation income consists of 50% of the
gross shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both
begin and end, in the United States.

GasLog Ltd. has qualified for the statutory tax exemption for the year of 2019 and intends to
continue to qualify for the foreseeable future. However, no assurance can be given that this will be the
case. If GasLog Ltd. is not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 for any taxable year, we would
be subject to the 4% U.S. Federal income tax described above. The imposition of this taxation could
have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for dividends to
our shareholders. For a more detailed discussion, see the section entitled ‘‘Item 10. Additional
Information—E. Tax Considerations—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—U.S. Taxation
of Our Operating Income’’.

**_If we were treated as a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’, certain adverse U.S. Federal income tax_**
**_consequences could result to U.S. shareholders._**

A foreign corporation will be treated as a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’, or ‘‘PFIC’’, for
U.S. Federal income tax purposes if at least 75% of its gross income for any tax year consists of certain

40


-----

types of ‘‘passive income’’, or at least 50% of the average value of the corporation’s assets produce or
are held for the production of those types of ‘‘passive income’’. For purposes of these tests, ‘‘passive
income’’ includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents
and royalties other than rents and royalties that are received from unrelated parties in connection with
the active conduct of a trade or business. For purposes of these tests, income derived from the
performance of services does not constitute ‘‘passive income’’. U.S. shareholders of a PFIC are subject
to a disadvantageous U.S. Federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the PFIC,
the distributions they receive from the PFIC and the gain, if any, they derive from the sale or other
disposition of their shares in the PFIC. If we are treated as a PFIC for any tax year, we will provide
information to U.S. shareholders who request such information to enable them to make certain
elections to alleviate certain of the adverse U.S. Federal income tax consequences that would arise as a
result of holding an interest in a PFIC.

Based on our proposed method of operation, we do not believe that GasLog Ltd. is a PFIC for
this tax year. In this regard, we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive
from our time chartering activities as services income, rather than rental income. Accordingly, we
believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute ‘‘passive income’’, and
the assets that we own and operate to produce that income do not constitute passive assets.

There is, however, no legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our proposed method of
operation. Accordingly, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or the ‘‘IRS’’, or a court of law may not
accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that we are a
PFIC. Moreover, GasLog Ltd. could constitute a PFIC for a future tax year if there were to be changes
in the nature and extent of our operations.

If the IRS were to find that GasLog Ltd. is or has been a PFIC for any tax year, U.S. shareholders
would face adverse tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless those shareholders make certain
elections available under the Code, such shareholders would be liable to pay U.S. Federal income tax
at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon excess distributions and
upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares, as if the excess
distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder’s holding period. Please read
‘‘Item 10. Additional Information—E. Tax Considerations—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders—PFIC Status and Significant Tax
Consequences’’ for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. Federal income tax consequences to U.S.
shareholders if GasLog Ltd. is treated as a PFIC.

**ITEM 4.** **INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY**

**A. History and Development of the Company**

GasLog was incorporated in Bermuda on July 16, 2003. GasLog and its subsidiaries are primarily
engaged in the ownership, operation and management of vessels in the LNG market, providing
maritime services for the transportation of LNG on a worldwide basis and LNG vessel management
services. The Group conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and through its vessel
management services subsidiary.

Our company and its founders have a long history in shipping and in LNG carriers. Our largest
shareholder is Ceres Shipping, whose founding family’s shipping activities commenced more than
100 years ago and which is currently controlled by our Chairman, Peter G. Livanos. Ceres Shipping
owns its shareholding in GasLog through its wholly owned subsidiary, Blenheim Holdings Ltd.
(‘‘Blenheim Holdings’’). Ceres Shipping entered the LNG sector in 2001 by undertaking the
management of BG Group’s owned fleet of LNG carriers through our subsidiary GasLog LNG
Services, and in 2003 GasLog Ltd. was incorporated. Until 2010, when we took delivery of the GasLog
_Savannah and the GasLog Singapore, our business principally consisted of providing technical ship_

41


-----

management services, as well as plan approval and construction supervision services for newbuilding
LNG carriers. As a result, we have had a longer presence in LNG shipping than many other
independent owners currently operating in the sector. For a description of our historical and current
capital expenditures, see ‘‘Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and
Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures’’.

On April 4, 2012, we completed our initial public offering, or ‘‘IPO’’, and our common shares
began trading on the NYSE on March 30, 2012 under the ticker symbol ‘‘GLOG’’. On January 22,
2014, GasLog completed a follow-on public offering of 10,925,000 common shares (including 1,425,000
common shares in relation to the over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters) and a
concurrent private placement of 2,317,460 common shares at the public offering price to certain of its
directors and officers and one of its major shareholders. The offering and private placement resulted in
net proceeds of $199.0 million which were used to partially finance the acquisition of the first three
ships acquired from MSL in 2014. On April 16, 2014, GasLog completed a second follow-on public
offering of 4,887,500 common shares (including 637,500 common shares in relation to the
over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters). The offering resulted in net proceeds of
$109.9 million which were used to partially finance the acquisition of the additional three ships
acquired from MSL in 2014.

On May 12, 2014, our subsidiary GasLog Partners completed an IPO of 9,660,000 common units
(including 1,260,000 units in relation to the over-allotment option exercised in full by the underwriters),
resulting in net proceeds of $186.0 million. GasLog Partners is a Marshall Islands master limited
partnership formed by us to own and operate LNG carriers under multi-year charters. Its common
units representing limited partner interests are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ‘‘GLOP’’.
Concurrently with the initial public offering, GasLog Partners acquired a 100.0% ownership interest in
GAS-three Ltd., GAS-four Ltd. and GAS-five Ltd., the entities that owned the GasLog Shanghai, the
_GasLog Santiago and the_ _GasLog Sydney, from GasLog, in exchange for (i) 162,358 common units and_
9,822,358 subordinated units issued to GasLog representing a 49.8% ownership interest and all of the
incentive distribution rights that entitled GasLog to increasing percentages of the cash that the
Partnership distributed in excess of $0.43125 per unit per quarter, (ii) 400,913 general partner units
issued to GasLog Partners GP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog, representing a 2.0% general
partner interest and (iii) $65.7 million of cash consideration paid directly to us from the offering
proceeds. In addition to the cash consideration of $65.7 million paid to us, GasLog Partners used the
$186.0 million net proceeds of its IPO to (a) prepay $82.6 million of debt plus accrued interest of
$0.4 million and (b) make a payment of $2.3 million (including $0.3 million accrued interest) to settle
the mark-to-market loss on termination of one interest rate swap and reduction of a second interest
rate swap in connection with the aforementioned debt prepayment. The balance of $35.0 million was
retained by GasLog Partners for general partnership purposes.

Since GasLog Partners’ IPO, the Partnership has completed follow-on equity offerings as set out
below, the proceeds of which have been used for general corporate purposes including partially funding
the acquisition of the GasLog subsidiaries that own the vessels listed below:

On April 7, 2015, GasLog completed a public offering of 4,600,000 Preference Shares, par value
$0.01 per share, liquidation preference $25.00 per share and priced at $25.00 per share, including
600,000 shares issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase
additional Preference Shares. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting
discounts, commissions and other offering expenses were $110.7 million to be used for general
corporate purposes. The Preference Shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol ‘‘GLOG PR A’’.

As of March 2, 2020, GasLog holds a 35.6% interest in the Partnership and, as a result of its
ownership of the general partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the
Partnership’s directors in accordance with the Partnership’s partnership agreement, or the ‘‘Partnership
Agreement’’, GasLog has the ability to control the Partnership’s affairs and policies. Consequently,
GasLog Partners is consolidated in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s control of the
general partner and consequently of the Partnership could be challenged with a 66.67% vote by other
unitholders. However, as the Partnership Agreement limits any single unitholder to a maximum of 4.9%
of the vote, it is highly unlikely that a coordinated vote of widely held unitholders will be organized to
change the Group’s control of the general partner. As a result, the Group continues to assume that
control of the general partner is a relevant basis on which to conclude control of the Partnership.

On October 1, 2015, GasLog, Dynagas and Golar established the Cool Pool to market their vessels
operating in the LNG shipping spot market. In June and July 2018, Dynagas removed its three vessels
from the Cool Pool and renounced its 33% ownership in the Cool Pool. On June 6, 2019, GasLog
entered into a termination agreement with the Cool Pool and Golar, whereby GasLog assumed
commercial control of its six vessels operating in the LNG carrier spot market through the Cool Pool at
that time. Following expiry of their commitments, GasLog vessels were withdrawn from the Cool Pool
in June and July 2019.

43


-----

On June 24, 2019, the Partnership Agreement was amended, effective June 30, 2019, to eliminate
the IDRs in exchange for the issuance by the Partnership to GasLog of 2,532,911 common units and
2,490,000 Class B units (of which 415,000 are Class B-1 units, 415,000 are Class B-2 units, 415,000 are
Class B-3 units, 415,000 are Class B-4 units, 415,000 are Class B-5 units and 415,000 are Class B-6
units), issued on June 30, 2019. The Class B units have all of the rights and obligations attached to the
common units, except for voting rights and participation in distributions until such time as GasLog
exercises its right to convert the Class B units to common units. The Class B units will become eligible
for conversion on a one-for-one basis into common units at GasLog’s option on July 1, 2020, July 1,
2021, July 1, 2022, July 1, 2023, July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025 for the Class B-1 units, Class B-2 units,
Class B-3 units, Class B-4 units, Class B-5 units and the Class B-6 units, respectively. Following the
IDR elimination, the allocation of GasLog Partners’ profit to the non-controlling interests is based on
the revised distribution policy for available cash stated in the Partnership Agreement as amended,
effective June 30, 2019, and under which 98% of the available cash is distributed to the common
unitholders and 2% is distributed to the general partner. The updated earnings allocation applies to the
total GasLog Partners’ profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and onwards.

**B. Business Overview**

**Overview**

We are an international owner, operator and manager of LNG carriers providing support to
international energy companies as part of their LNG logistics chain. Our owned and bareboat fleet as
of March 2, 2020, consists of 35 LNG carriers, including 28 ships on the water and seven LNG carriers
on order at one of the world’s leading LNG shipbuilders, Samsung. This includes 15 LNG carriers in
operation that are owned by GasLog Partners, with which we have entered into certain agreements
governing our relationship, including purchase options for certain of our ships. We currently manage
and operate 28 LNG carriers including 12 of our wholly owned ships in operation, 14 ships contributed
or sold to the Partnership (one is managed by a subsidiary of Shell), one additional LNG carrier in
which we have a 25.0% interest and a vessel secured under a long-term bareboat charter from Lepta
Shipping, a subsidiary of Mitsui. We are also supervising the construction of our newbuildings. We
operate our vessels primarily under term charters of one year or longer with six vessels, of which one is
owned by GasLog Partners, currently trading in the spot and short-term market. As of December 31,
2019, these contracts are expected to provide total contracted revenues of $4.0 billion during their
initial terms, which expire between 2020 and 2032. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we generated revenues
of $668.6 million, $618.3 million and $525.2 million, respectively. For disaggregation of revenues, see
‘‘Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Operating Results—Customers’’.

The LNG carrier in which we have a 25.0% interest is the Methane Nile Eagle, a 2007-built LNG
carrier technically managed by us that is currently operating under a 20-year time charter to MSL.

44


-----

Our current time charters have initial terms of up to 12 years and include options that permit the
charterers to extend the terms for successive periods under hire rate provisions. We will continue to
evaluate the attractiveness of longer and shorter-term chartering opportunities as the commercial
characteristics of the LNG carrier industry evolve. Our orderbook of new LNG carriers has staggered
delivery dates, facilitating a smooth integration of the ships into our fleet as well as significant annual
growth through 2021. This has the additional advantage of spreading our exposure to the re-delivery of
these ships over several years upon expiration of their current charters.

Each of our 28 owned and bareboat LNG carriers and seven LNG carriers under construction is
designed with a capacity of between approximately 145,000 cbm and 180,000 cbm. We believe this size
range maximizes their operational flexibility as these ships are compatible with most existing LNG
terminals around the world. All but one of the LNG carriers in our owned and bareboat fleet are of
similar specifications, which allows us to benefit from economies of scale and operating efficiencies in
ship construction, crew training, crew rotation and shared spare parts. Upon delivery of the last of our
seven contracted newbuildings, our owned and bareboat fleet will have an average age of 7.0 years,
making it one of the youngest in the industry. By comparison, as of December 31, 2019, the average
age for the global trading LNG carrier fleet including LNG carriers of all sizes, was 10.0 years.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, GasLog LNG Services, exclusively handles the technical management
of our fleet, including plan approval for new ship orders, supervision of ship construction and planning
and supervision of dry-dockings, as well as technical operations, crewing, training, maintenance,
regulatory and classification compliance and health, safety, security and environmental, or ‘‘HSSE’’,
management and reporting. With over 19 years of technical management experience, including 15 years
as sole technical manager of BG Group’s owned fleet of LNG carriers, we have established a track
record for the efficient, safe and reliable operation of LNG carriers which is evidenced by our safety
performance and the limited off-hire days of the 28 ships currently operating under our management.

A wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog acquired a 20% shareholding in Gastrade in 2016. Gastrade
is licensed to develop an independent natural gas system offshore Alexandroupolis in Northern Greece
utilizing a FSRU along with other fixed infrastructure. A wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog has
executed an FSRU Operation and Maintenance Agreement with Gastrade. This agreement is tied to
the Terminal Use Agreement and subject to final investment decision (‘‘FID’’) of the Alexandroupolis
Project.

On January 11, 2019, Gastrade announced that the first phase of the regulatory market test for
long-term capacity in the Alexandroupolis FSRU was concluded with responses from 20 companies with
an aggregated interest for up to 12.2 billion cubic meters per year of regasification capacity. This is
more than double the nominal planned capacity of the terminal.

On July 26, 2019, the Guidelines for the second phase of the market test were released in
preparation for the launch of the market test itself in early 2020. In this second phase, participants will
be required to sign an advanced reservation capacity agreement with binding commitments to take
long-term capacity. The second phase of the market test commenced on January 10, 2020 and is
currently expected to conclude in April.

On September 29, 2019, Gastrade released the Engineering Procurement and Construction tender
for the construction of the pipeline and offshore installation contract. The FSRU procurement tender
to shortlisted companies is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2020. Should GasLog be
selected as the provider of the FSRU, it is currently expected that we would sell a TFDE vessel
converted to a FSRU to Gastrade.

On December 30, 2019, DEPA, the Greek State Gas Company, signed agreements to acquire 20%
of the shares in Gastrade. The closing of the acquisition is pending a ‘‘no objection’’ consent from
Greek competition authorities. The Bulgarian parliament has approved the acquisition of 20% of the
shares in Gastrade by BulgarTransgaz, the Bulgarian State Gas Transport Company. A preliminary
agreement has been executed and the completion is expected in early 2020.

45


-----

Gastrade currently expects to take FID on the project in the third quarter of 2020 with the
purchase of the FSRU and start-up of the facility anticipated to occur approximately two years after
FID.

In September 2019, GasLog announced that a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog had signed a
10-year time charter with Sinolam for the provision of a LNG FSU to a gas-fired power project being
developed on Panama. The time charter is expected to be fulfilled through the conversion of the
_GasLog Singapore. The FSU will receive, store and send out LNG to a gas-fired power plant currently_
being developed near Col´on, Panama, by Sinolam Smarter energy LNG Power Company, a subsidiary
of private Chinese investment group Shanghai Gorgeous Investment Development Company. The
power project has signed long-term power purchase agreements with leading Panamanian utility
companies as well as a 15-year LNG sale and purchase agreement with Shell.

In November 2019, GasLog announced plans to relocate more of its employees including several
members of senior management to the Piraeus, Greece office, home of our operational platform, in
order to enhance execution, efficiency and operational excellence and to reduce overheads. As a result,
the Monaco office will reduce the already limited number of employees, whilst the London office will
focus primarily on chartering activities and company secretarial duties. The offices in Singapore, Korea
and the U.S. will be unaffected by the changes. We expect to incur total restructuring costs of
approximately $6.0 million. A restructuring charge of $4.7 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of
2019 but the cash costs of the restructuring will be primarily incurred in 2020. In 2021 and beyond, we
expect like-for-like General and Administrative Expenses to fall by a similar amount of approximately
$6.0 million.

On February 6, 2020, GasLog Partners announced a non-cash impairment on its five Steam vessels
and guided towards a reduction in its quarterly distribution from the first quarter of 2020 as a result of
a number of increasingly strong negative indicators in the LNG shipping market. GasLog Partners is
now focusing capital allocation on debt repayment and prioritizing balance sheet strength for 2020, in
order to lower cash break-evens and to reposition the Partnership for potential future growth if its cost
of capital allows GasLog Partners to access debt and equity capital on acceptable terms.

**_Charter Expirations_**

The Methane Rita Andrea, the _GasLog Sydney, the Methane Shirley Elisabeth, the Methane Lydon_
_Volney, the Methane Jane Elizabeth and the_ _Methane Heather Sally are due to come off charter in April_
2020, June 2020, June 2020, October 2020, November 2020 and December 2020, respectively, each plus
or minus 30 days. GasLog Partners and GasLog continue to pursue opportunities for new term charters
with third parties and, on an interim basis, will trade the vessels in the spot/short-term charter market,
pursuing the most advantageous redeployment depending on evolving market conditions.

**_Key Fleet Characteristics_**

The key characteristics of our current owned and bareboat fleet include the following:

-  each ship is sized at between approximately 145,000 cbm and 180,000 cbm capacity, which places
our ships in the medium- to large-size class of LNG carriers; we believe this size range
maximizes their efficiency and operational flexibility, as these ships are compatible with most
existing LNG terminals around the world;

-  each ship is double-hulled, which is standard in the LNG industry;

-  each ship has a membrane containment system incorporating current industry construction
standards, including guidelines and recommendations from Gaztransport and Technigaz (the
designer of the membrane system) as well as updated standards from our classification society;

-  each of our ships is equipped with a modern steam turbine or has TFDE or X-DF engine
propulsion technology;

-  Bermuda is the flag state of each ship with the exception of the GasLog Warsaw which has a
Hellenic flag;

-  each of our delivered ships has received, and each of our newbuildings is expected to receive, an
ENVIRO+ notation from our classification society, which denotes compliance with its published
guidelines concerning the most stringent criteria for environmental protection related to design
characteristics, management and support systems, sea discharges and air emissions; and

-  upon delivery of the last of our seven contracted newbuildings in 2021, our owned fleet will have
an average age of 7.0 years, making it one of the youngest in the industry, compared to a

48


-----

current average age of 10.0 years for the global trading LNG carrier fleet including LNG
carriers of all sizes as of December 31, 2019.

In addition to our owned and bareboat fleet, we have a 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG,
an entity whose principal asset is the Methane Nile Eagle. The Methane Nile Eagle is a 145,000 cbm
LNG carrier that was built in 2007. It is currently chartered to MSL under a 20-year time charter,
which is subject to extension for up to 10 years at the charterer’s option.

We continually evaluate short-term and multi-year charter opportunities for our vessels, including
the newbuildings for which we do not currently have charters fixed. Our discussions with potential
charterers are at various stages of advancement; however, we cannot provide assurance that we will
conclude any particular charter or, if concluded, as to the charter rate that will apply.

**_Managed Fleet_**

Through GasLog LNG Services, we provide technical ship management services for one LNG
carrier owned by a third party in addition to management of the 27 LNG carriers currently operating in
our owned and bareboat fleet (the _Solaris is managed by a subsidiary of Shell). We supervised the_
construction by Samsung or Hyundai of each LNG carrier in our managed fleet, and each ship has
operated under our technical management since its delivery from the shipyard with the exception of the
_Solaris._

The following table provides information about our managed, third party owned ship (not
including the bareboat vessel):

**Cargo** **GasLog** **Charter**
**Vessel Name** **Year Built** **Capacity (cbm)** **Propulsion** **Ownership** **Ship Owner** **Expiration**

**1** _Methane Nile Eagle[(1)]_ . . 2007 145,000 Steam 25.0% Egypt LNG[(1)] 2027

(1) The Methane Nile Eagle is owned by Egypt LNG in which we indirectly hold a 25.0% equity interest. Shell Integrated Gas
Thailand PTE. Ltd., a subsidiary of Shell, and Eagle Gas Shipping Co. E.S.A., an entity affiliated with the government of
Egypt, have 25.0% and 50.0% equity interests, respectively, in Egypt LNG.

**Ship Time Charters**

We provide the services of our ships under time charters. A time charter is a contract for the use
of the ship for a specified term at a daily hire rate. Under a time charter, the ship owner provides
crewing and other services related to the ship’s operation, the cost of which is covered by the hire rate,
and the customer is responsible for substantially all of the ship voyage costs (including bunker fuel,
port charges, canal fees and LNG boil-off).

We entered into master time charters with MSL that established the general terms under which
the GasLog Greece, the _GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog Geneva, the GasLog Gibraltar, the GasLog_
_Houston, the GasLog Genoa and the GasLog Gladstone will be chartered to MSL. We enter into_
separate confirmation memorandums for each ship in order to supplement the master time charter and
specify the charter term, extension options (if any), hire rate and other provisions applicable to each
ship’s charter.

We have entered into time charter agreements with a subsidiary of Shell, establishing the terms
under which the GasLog Seattle and the _Solaris will be chartered to Shell._

The GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Skagen, the Gaslog Saratoga, the GasLog Singapore, GasLog
_Savannah and the Methane Alison Victoria are trading in the spot/short-term charter market and from_
time to time enter into voyage or short-term time charters.

49


-----

The GasLog Salem and the _GasLog Shanghai are operating under time charter agreements with_
Gunvor which are based on a market-related structure where the hire rate is adjusted for each voyage
and is subject to agreed minimum and maximum rates of hire. We have entered into a time charter
agreement with Cheniere, establishing the terms under which the GasLog Warsaw will be chartered to
Cheniere from August 2019 to May 2021. We have entered into a time charter agreement with Endesa,

The following discussion describes the material terms of the time charters for our owned and
bareboat ships.

**_Initial Term, Extensions and Redelivery_**

The initial term of the time charters for the Methane Lydon Volney, the Methane Rita Andrea, the
_Methane Shirley Elisabeth, and the_ _Methane Heather Sally began upon delivery to GasLog following their_
acquisition from MSL in 2014, and will terminate on various dates in 2020.

The initial term charter for the Methane Becki Anne to MSL began upon delivery of the ship and
will terminate in 2024. MSL has options to extend the terms of the charter for an additional period of
either three or five years beyond the initial charter expiration date.

The initial term of the time charter for the GasLog Greece, the GasLog Glasgow, the GasLog
_Geneva and the GasLog Gibraltar began upon delivery of the ships and will terminate in 2026, 2026,_
2023 and 2023, respectively. For the GasLog Greece and the GasLog Glasgow, MSL has options to
extend the terms of the charters for up to five years and for the GasLog Geneva and the GasLog
_Gibraltar, MSL has the option to extend the terms of the charters for up to 8 years._

The GasLog Houston was delivered from the shipyard in January 2018 and delivered into her time
charter with MSL in January 2019. The initial charter term for the ship will terminate in 2028. MSL
has options to extend the terms of the charter for two consecutive periods of three years each, all at
specified hire rates.

Our time charter to MSL for the _GasLog Genoa began when the ship was delivered from the_
shipyard in March 2018. The initial charter term for the ship will terminate in 2027. The time charter
to MSL for the GasLog Gladstone began when the ship was delivered from the shipyard in March 2019.
The initial charter term for the ship will terminate in 2029. MSL has options to extend terms of the
charters for the GasLog Genoa and the GasLog Gladstone for two consecutive periods of three years
each, all at specified hire rates.

The initial term of the time charter for the GasLog Seattle and the Solaris began upon delivery of
the ships following an initial period during which the ships operated under maiden voyage time
charters, the purpose of which was to facilitate completion by Shell of an operational discharge
inspection of the ships. The time charters for the GasLog Seattle and the Solaris will terminate in 2021.

The initial term of the time charter for the Methane Julia Louise began upon delivery to GasLog
and will terminate in 2026. MSL has the option to extend the long-term bareboat charter of the
_Methane Julia Louise which is now owned by Lepta Shipping and leased back to GasLog, for an_
additional period of either three or five years beyond the initial charter expiration date.

Our time charter to Total for the GasLog Hong Kong began when the ship was delivered from the
shipyard in March 2018. The initial charter term will terminate in 2025. Total has the option to extend
the term of the charter by a three-year period at the charterer’s option at a specified hire rate.

The initial time charter for the GasLog Warsaw to Cheniere began when the ship was delivered in
August 2019 and will terminate in May 2021. Our time charter to Endesa for the GasLog Warsaw
begins in May 2021. The initial charter term will terminate in 2029. Endesa has the option to extend
the term of the charter by two six-year periods beyond the initial charter expiration date.

Our time charters to Centrica for Hull No. 2213 and Hull No. 2262 will begin upon delivery of the
vessels in 2020. The initial charter terms will terminate in 2027. Centrica has the option to extend the
term of the charters by three consecutive periods of two years each at the charterer’s option.

Our time charters to Cheniere for Hull Nos. 2300, 2301, 2311 and 2312 will begin upon delivery of
the vessels from the shipyard in 2020, 2020, 2021 and 2021, respectively. The initial charter terms will
terminate in 2027 (Hull Nos. 2300 and 2301) and 2028 (Hull Nos. 2311 and 2312). Cheniere has the
option to extend the term of each of the charters by three consecutive periods of three years, two years
and two years, respectively.

The rates and period for the fixtures of the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog
_Chelsea, the GasLog Skagen, the_ _Methane Alison Victoria and the GasLog Saratoga vary from charter to_
charter, as is the nature of trading in the spot/short-term charter market.

Our time charters to Gunvor for the GasLog Salem and the GasLog Shanghai began in June 2019
and the charters will terminate in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

Our time charter to Jera for Hull No. 2274 will begin upon delivery of the vessel in 2020. The
initial charter terms will terminate in 2032. Jera has the option to extend the term of the charter by
two consecutive periods of three years.

Our time charters provide for redelivery of the ship to us at the expiration of the term, as such
term may be extended upon the charterer’s exercise of its extension options, or upon earlier
termination of the charter (as described below) plus or minus 30 days. Under all of our charters, the
charterer has the right to extend the term for most periods in which the ship is off-hire. Our charter
contracts do not provide the charterers with options to purchase our ships during or upon expiration of
the charter term.

**_Hire Rate Provisions_**

‘‘Hire rate’’ refers to the basic payment from the customer for use of the ship. Under all of our
time charters, the hire rate is payable to us monthly in advance in U.S. dollars. Depending on the time
charter contract, there are four methods by which the daily hire rate for our owned ships is
determined:

-  Under the first method, the hire rate includes two components: a capital cost component and an
operating cost component. The capital cost component relates to the total cost of the ship’s
construction and is a fixed daily amount that is structured to provide a return on our invested
capital. Some of the charters provide for the capital cost component to increase by a specified
amount during any option period. The operating cost component is a fixed daily amount that
increases annually at a fixed percentage. Although the daily amount of the operating cost
component is fixed (subject to a specified annual increase), it is intended to correspond to the

51


-----

costs of operating the ship and related expenses. In the event of a material increase or decrease
in the actual costs we incur in operating the ship, a clause in the charter provides each party the
right in certain circumstances to seek a review and potential adjustment of the operating cost
component.

-  Under the second method, the hire rate includes only one component that is a fixed daily
amount that will either remain the same, increase or decrease by a specified amount during any
option period as compared to the firm period.

-  Under the third method, the hire rate for an initial period of up to two years, at the charterer’s
option, will be set at the prevailing market rate for a comparable ship, subject to a cap and a
floor. Following such initial period, the hire rate will be calculated based on three components—
a capital cost component, an operating cost component and a ship management fee. The capital
cost component is a fixed daily amount which will increase by a specified amount during any
option period. The daily amount of the operating cost component, which is intended to fully
pass-through to the charterer the costs of operating the ship, is set annually and adjusted at the
end of each year to compensate us for the actual costs we incur in operating the ship.
Dry-docking expenses are budgeted in advance and are reimbursed by the charterers
immediately following a dry-docking. The ship management fee is a daily amount set in line with
industry practice for fees charged by ship managers and is intended to compensate us for
management of the ship.

-  Under the fourth method, the hire rate is based on a base hire rate adjustment mechanism for
each voyage and is calculated by taking the average of the daily spot market headline rates of
three broker reports. The three broker reports used for this calculation shall be drawn from the
week which contains the date that is twenty (20) days prior to each loading date. The voyage is
defined as being from drop last pilot at the discharge port until the drop last pilot at next
discharge port. For each voyage, the broker average daily rate, shall be subject to certain
adjustments to determine the ‘‘Actual daily hire rate’’ of that voyage. The hire rate for each
voyage is subject to maximum ceiling and minimum floor rates.

The hire rates for each of our ships may be reduced if the ship does not perform to certain of its
specifications or if we breach our obligations under the charter. We have had no instances of hire rate
reductions since the first two of our owned ships commenced operations in 2010.

**_Off-Hire_**

When a ship is ‘‘off-hire’’—or not available for service—a time charterer generally is not required
to pay the hire rate, and we remain responsible for all costs, including the cost of any LNG cargo lost
as boil-off during such off-hire periods. The vast majority of our time charters provide an annual
allowance period for us to schedule preventative maintenance work on the ships, whilst for some other
charters, there are other provisions in place to ensure the same. For the vessels operating in the
short-term spot market we take advantage of any stub period to enable us to perform the required
maintenance. Our ships are being maintained to the highest standards in accordance with the maker’s
maintenance schedule. A ship generally will be deemed off-hire under our time charters if there is a
specified time outside of the annual allowance period when the ship is not available for the charterer’s
use due to, among other things, operational deficiencies (including the failure to maintain a certain
guaranteed speed), dry-docking for repairs, maintenance or inspection, equipment breakdowns,
deficiency of personnel or neglect of duty by the ship’s officers or crew, deviation from course, or
delays due to accidents, quarantines, ship detentions or similar problems. We have obtained loss of hire
insurance to protect us against loss of income as a result of a ship being off-hire. See ‘‘—Risk of Loss,
Insurance and Risk Management—Loss of Hire Insurance’’.

52


-----

All ships are dry-docked at least once every five years for a special survey as required by the ship’s
classification society. Our ships are considered to be on a scheduled off-hire under our time charters
during such periods.

**_Termination and Cancellation_**

Under our existing time charters, each party has certain termination rights which include, among
other things, the automatic termination of a charter upon loss of the relevant ship. Either party may
elect to terminate a charter upon the occurrence of specified defaults or upon the outbreak of war or
hostilities involving two or more major nations, such as the United States or the People’s Republic of
China, if such war or hostilities materially and adversely affect the trading of the ship for a period of at
least 30 days. In addition, our charterers have the option to terminate a charter if the relevant ship is
off-hire for any reason other than scheduled dry-docking for a period exceeding 90 consecutive days, or
for more than 90 days or 110 days, depending on the charter, in any one-year period. Certain of our
charters give the charterer a termination option for shorter periods of off-hire, if such off-hire is due to
an uncured breach of our obligations to maintain the applicable ship.

In addition to its termination rights, Shell has the right to convert the time charter with respect to
the relevant ship into a bareboat charter upon the occurrence of specified defaults or in the event that
Shell’s quality assurance review is not successfully completed upon delivery of the ship.

All of the time charters applicable to our newbuildings permit the charterer to cancel the charter
in the event of a prolonged delay in the delivery of the ship from the shipyard, and in certain
circumstances obligate us to pay liquidated damages to the charterer in the event of a less significant
delivery delay. However, the cancellation and liquidated damages provisions in our charters are
structured to mirror the provisions of our contracts with the shipyard, giving us the right to receive
liquidated damages from the shipyard or cancel the shipbuilding contract in the same circumstances
that would trigger the charterer’s right to cancel the charter contract or receive liquidated damages
because of delivery delays.

**_The Bareboat Charter_**

On February 24, 2016, GasLog’s subsidiary, GAS-twenty six Ltd., completed the sale and leaseback
of the Methane Julia Louise with Lepta Shipping. Lepta Shipping has the right to on-sell and lease back
the vessel. The vessel was sold to Lepta Shipping for a total consideration approximately equivalent to
its book value at the time of the sale. GasLog has leased back the vessel under a bareboat charter from
Lepta Shipping for a period of up to 20 years. GasLog has the option to re-purchase the vessel on
pre-agreed terms no earlier than the end of year ten and no later than the end of year 17 of the
bareboat charter. The vessel remains on its 11 year charter with MSL.

**Shipbuilding Contracts**

We have entered into shipbuilding contracts with Samsung in respect of seven newbuildings which
have an aggregate contract price of approximately $1.3 billion. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate
outstanding balance was $1.1 billion, which will be paid in installments upon steel cutting, keel laying
and launching of the ship, with the largest portion of the purchase price for each ship coming due upon
its delivery. All of our obligations under the shipbuilding contracts are payable in U.S. dollars.

end of ocr table
As of December 31, 2019, our remaining payment obligations under the shipbuilding contracts
were as follows:

**As of**
**December 31, 2019[(1)]**

**(in thousands of U.S.**
**dollars)**
Amounts due in less than one year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 801,845
Amounts due in one to three years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 311,190

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **1,113,035**

(1) Instalments of $18.5 million have already been paid in 2020 to date.

The shipbuilding contracts provide for the seven newbuildings to be delivered and ready for
immediate operation on various dates in 2020 and 2021. The shipbuilding contracts require Samsung to
pay us liquidated damages in the event of certain delays in the delivery of a ship unless such delays are
attributable to a force majeure event and, in the event of a prolonged delay, we would have the right
to cancel the contract and receive a refund of any installment payments previously made on the ship.

In the event that we fail to meet our payment obligations under a shipbuilding contract, we would
be in default under the applicable contract and would be obligated to pay interest under the contract.
If such a default by us were to continue for more than five business days, the delivery date of the
applicable ship would be delayed by one day for each day that we remain in default and, if a default by
us were to continue for more than 15 business days, Samsung would have the option of cancelling the
applicable shipbuilding contract and retaining any installment payments previously funded by us under
the contract.

**Ship Management Services and Construction Supervision**

Except for the Solaris, which is managed by a subsidiary of Shell, management of our owned and
bareboat fleet, which includes plan approval for new ship orders, supervision of ship construction and
planning and supervision of dry-dockings, as well as technical operations, crewing, training,
maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting, is
provided in-house by our wholly owned subsidiary, GasLog LNG Services, an entity incorporated in
Bermuda with an office in Piraeus, Greece. In addition to management of our owned and bareboat
fleet, through GasLog LNG Services we provide technical ship management services for the Methane
_Nile Eagle, a ship in which we have a 25.0% ownership interest. During the year ended December 31,_
2019, ship management services provided to external customers accounted for approximately 0.1% of
our consolidated revenues.

**_Construction Supervision_**

We supervise and manage the construction of our newbuildings through GasLog LNG Services. We
have employees on-site in South Korea whose responsibilities include inspecting the ships under
construction for non-conformities, attending trials of the ship and its machinery and equipment,
consulting with the shipyard in the event of any modifications to the ship’s specifications, reviewing the
shipyard’s choice of suppliers and sub-contractors and keeping our management informed of the
progress of the construction. Through GasLog LNG Services, we also supervised the construction of
three LNG carriers in Shell’s owned fleet and the Methane Nile Eagle, all of which were constructed at
Samsung.

**_Technical and Operational Management_**

Pursuant to ship management agreements, through GasLog LNG Services we manage the
day-to-day aspects of ship operations for our owned and bareboat fleet (with the exception of the
_Solaris) and for the Methane Nile Eagle owned by Egypt LNG. The services provided include crewing,_
training, employing armed guards for transport in certain high-risk areas, insurance, maintenance and
repair, procurement of supplies and equipment, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE
management and reporting, as well as dry-docking under certain charters. We utilize certain third-party
sub-contractors and suppliers in carrying out our technical management responsibilities.

In the case of the Methane Nile Eagle, the crewing and other operational costs are fully passedthrough to the ship owner, and the customer pays us a management fee per month for our technical
management services. In connection with our ship management services provided to the Methane Nile
_Eagle, we have entered into a consultant service agreement pursuant to which we provide specialized_
services relating to the management of the LNG carrier. These services include the development and
installation of a ship’s ship management system, which includes installing onboard hardware and
software systems and providing related training to the ship’s personnel. The terms of the Methane Nile
_Eagle ship management agreement and related contracts permit the customer to terminate our services_
for any reason upon a short period of advance notice and both parties have termination rights upon the
occurrence of specified defaults. In the event of the loss of a ship, or the owner’s sale of a ship to a
third party, the ship management agreement in respect of the ship would terminate automatically.

**Competition**

We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand.
Generally, competition for LNG time charters is based primarily on charter party terms including price,
ship availability, size, age, technical specifications and condition, LNG shipping experience, quality and
efficiency of ship operations, including level of emissions, shipping industry relationships and reputation
for customer service, and technical ability and reputation for operation of highly specialized ships. In
addition, through the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Chelsea, the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog
_Skagen, the GasLog Saratoga, the GasLog Salem and through the GasLog Partners vessel, the Methane_
_Alison Victoria, we operate in the spot /short-term charter market that covers charters of one year or_
less or under charters which are based on a variable hire rate.

Although we believe that we are one of a small number of large independent owners who focus
primarily on modern, technically advanced LNG carriers, a growing number of other independent
shipping companies also own and operate, and in some cases manage, LNG carriers and have new
ships under construction. Several of these other ship owners and managers have decided to enter, or to
expand their presence in, the LNG market with newbuilding vessels over the last year, and potentially
others may also attempt to participate in the LNG market in the future. A number of these
newbuildings are uncommitted and may also compete in the spot/short-term charter market on delivery.
We believe that our strategy of focusing primarily on charter contracts with initial terms of seven to ten
years, as well as the scale of our technical ship management operations, differentiates us to some extent
from other independent owners.

In addition to independent owners, some of the major oil and gas producers own LNG carriers
and, in the recent past, have contracted for the construction of new LNG carriers. Certain national oil
and gas and shipping companies also have large fleets of LNG carriers that have expanded and may
continue to expand. Some of these companies, as well as other market participants such as trading
companies who have LNG shipping capacity contracted on multi-year charters, may compete with
independent owners by using their fleets to carry LNG for third parties.

**Seagoing and Shore-Based Employees**

As of December 31, 2019, we had 163 full-time employees and contractors based in our offices in
Greece, Monaco, London, Stamford Connecticut, Singapore and the newbuildings site in South Korea.
In addition to our shore-based employees and contractors, we had approximately 1,654 seafaring staff
serving on our owned and managed ships. These seafarers are retained through crewing agencies based
in Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain or, in the case of Greek seafarers, through direct hire. As we
take delivery of our newbuildings, we expect to recruit a significant number of additional seafarers
qualified to staff and operate our new ships, as well as a small number of additional shore-based
personnel. We intend to focus our seafarer hiring efforts in the Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain,
where we have crewing agency agreements in place, and in Greece.

LNG marine transportation is a specialized area requiring technically skilled officers and personnel
with specialized training. Attracting and retaining motivated, well-qualified seagoing and shore-based
personnel is a top priority, and we offer our people competitive compensation packages and training
and development opportunities. In addition, we provide intensive onboard training for our officers and
crews to instill a culture focused on the highest operational and safety standards. As a result, we have
historically enjoyed high retention rates. In 2019, our retention rate was 97% for senior seagoing
officers, 93% for other seagoing officers and 94% for shore staff.

Although we have historically experienced high employee retention rates, the demand for
technically skilled officers and crews to serve on LNG carriers and FSRU vessels, and for shore-based
employees with experience of operating and managing LNG vessels, has been increasing as the global
fleet of LNG vessels continues to grow. This increased demand has and may continue to put
inflationary cost pressure on ensuring qualified and well-trained crew are available to GasLog.
However, we expect that the impact of cost increases would be mitigated to some extent by certain
provisions in some of our time charters, including automatic periodic adjustment and cost review
provisions.

**Classification, Inspection and Maintenance**

Every large, commercial seagoing ship must be ‘‘classed’’ by a classification society. The
classification society certifies that the ship is ‘‘in class’’, signifying that the ship has been built and
maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules
and regulations of the ship’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country
is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding
laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by
official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned. The classification society also undertakes
on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state.
These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the
country concerned.

To ensure each ship is maintained in accordance with classification society standards and for
maintenance of the class certificate, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull and machinery, including
the electrical plant, and any special equipment classes are required to be performed periodically.
Surveys are based on a five-year cycle that consists of annual surveys, intermediate surveys that are
typically completed between the second and third years of every five-year cycle, and comprehensive
special surveys (also known as class renewal surveys) that are completed at each fifth anniversary of the
ship’s delivery.

All areas subject to surveys as defined by the classification society, are required to be surveyed at
least once per five-year class cycle, unless shorter intervals between surveys are mandated. All ships are
also required to be dry-docked at least once during every five-year class cycle for inspection of their
underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. If any defects are found, the classification

56


-----

surveyor will issue a ‘‘recommendation’’ which must be rectified by the ship owner within prescribed
time limits. We intend to dry-dock our ships at five-year intervals that coincide with the completion of
the ship’s special survey.

Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a ship be certified as
‘‘in class’’ by a classification society that is a member of the International Association of Classification
Societies. All but two of our delivered ships are certified by the American Bureau of Shipping, or
‘‘ABS’’; the other delivered ships are certified by the Det Norske Veritas. Each ship has been awarded
International Safety Management (‘‘ISM’’) certification and is currently ‘‘in class’’. Under our
shipbuilding contracts, all of our contracted newbuildings must be certified prior to delivery to us.

The following table lists the years in which we expect to carry out the next or initial dry-dockings
and special surveys for our owned fleet and the bareboat vessel as of March 2, 2020:

**Risk of Loss, Insurance and Risk Management**

The operation of any ship has inherent risks. These risks include mechanical failure, personal
injury, collision, property loss or damage, ship or cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to
a number of reasons, including mechanical failure, a cyber event, political circumstances in foreign
countries, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine
disaster, including explosion, spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from
owning and operating ships in international trade.

We maintain hull and machinery insurance on all our owned and bareboat ships against marine
and war risks in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover such risks, as well as loss of hire
insurance against loss of income as a result of a ship being off-hire or otherwise suffering a loss of
operational time for events falling under our hull and machinery insurance. In addition, we maintain
protection and indemnity insurance on all our owned and bareboat ships up to the maximum insurable
limit available at any given time. We also maintain ship manager insurance in respect of our managed
vessel and cyber insurance coverage for all our owned and bareboat ships. While we believe that our
insurance coverage will be adequate, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that
we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates or at all, or that any
specific claim we may make under our insurance coverage will be paid.

**_Hull & Machinery Marine Risks Insurance and Hull & Machinery War Risks Insurance_**

We maintain hull and machinery marine risks insurance and hull and machinery war risks
insurance on our owned and bareboat ships, which cover loss of or damage to a ship due to marine
perils such as collisions, fire or lightning, and loss of or damage to a ship due to war perils such as acts
of war, terrorism or piracy. Each of our ships is insured under these policies for a total amount that
exceeds what we believe to be its fair market value. We also maintain hull disbursements and increased
value insurance policies covering each of our owned ships, which provide additional coverage in the
event of the total or constructive loss of a ship. Our marine risks insurance policies contain deductible
amounts for which we will be responsible, but there are no deductible amounts under our war risks
policies or our total loss policies.

**_Loss of Hire Insurance/Delay Insurance_**

We maintain loss of hire insurance to protect us against loss of income as a result of a ship being
off-hire or otherwise suffering a loss of operational time for events falling under the terms of our hull
and machinery insurance or hull and machinery/war risks insurance. Under our loss of hire policy, our
insurer will pay us the hire rate agreed in respect of each ship for each day, in excess of a certain
number of deductible days, for the time that the ship is out of service as a result of damage, up to a
maximum of 180 days. The number of deductible days for the ships in our fleet is 14 days per ship. In
addition to the loss of hire insurance, we also have in place delay insurance which, like loss of hire,
covers all of our owned and bareboat vessels for time lost due to events falling under the terms of our
hull and machinery insurance, plus additional protection and indemnity related incidents. The policy
has a deductible of two days with a maximum of 12 days (which brings it in line with the loss of hire
deductible of 14 days) and a daily rate per vessel of $40,000 for our wholly owned and bareboat vessels
or the hire rate agreed as per the loss of hire insurance policy for the Partnership’s vessels.

Additionally, we buy piracy, loss of hire and kidnap and ransom insurance when our ships are
ordered to sail through the Indian Ocean to insure against potential losses relating to the hijacking of a
ship and its crew by pirates.

**_Protection and Indemnity Insurance_**

Protection and indemnity insurance is typically provided by a protection and indemnity association,
or ‘‘P&I association’’, and covers third-party liability, crew liability and other related expenses resulting
from injury to or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, loss of or damage to cargo, thirdparty claims arising from collisions with other ships (to the extent not recovered by the hull and
machinery policies), damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances
and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal.

Our protection and indemnity insurance covering our owned and bareboat ships is provided by
P&I associations that are members of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, or
‘‘International Group’’. The 13 P&I associations that comprise the International Group insure
approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to
reinsure each association’s liabilities. Insurance provided by a P&I association is a form of mutual
indemnity insurance.

Our protection and indemnity insurance is currently subject to limits of $3.0 billion per ship per
event in respect of liability to passengers and seamen, $2.0 billion per ship per event in respect of
liability to passengers and $1.0 billion per ship per event in respect of liability for oil pollution.

As a member of a P&I association, we will be subject to calls, payable to the P&I association
based on the International Group’s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of
the P&I association of which we are a member.

**_Cyber Insurance_**

We have insurance coverage for cyber related risks. The policy covers physical damage to any of
our vessels up to $50.0 million per vessel with a fleet aggregate limit of $150 million for each of the
GasLog and GasLog Partners fleets.

**Safety Performance**

We provide intensive onboard training for our officers and crews to instill a culture of the highest
operational and safety standards. During 2019, GasLog’s fleet experienced nil recordable injuries and
eleven first aid cases.

**Permits and Authorizations**

We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain
permits, licenses, financial assurances and certificates with respect to our ships. The kinds of permits,
licenses, financial assurances and certificates required will depend upon several factors, including the
waters in which the ship operates, the nationality of the ship’s crew and the age of the ship. We have
obtained all permits, licenses, financial assurances and certificates currently required to operate our
ships. Additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit
our ability to do business or increase our cost of doing business.

**Environmental and Other Regulation**

The carriage, handling, storage and regasification of LNG are subject to extensive laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety and other matters. These
laws and regulations include international conventions and national, state and local laws and regulations
in the countries where our ships now or in the future will operate, or where our ships are registered.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and may impact the resale
value or useful lives of our ships. Our ships may be subject to both scheduled and unscheduled
inspections by a variety of governmental, quasi-governmental and private organizations, including the

59


-----

local port authorities, national authorities, harbor masters or equivalent, classification societies, flag
state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers. Failure to maintain permits, licenses,
certificates or other authorizations required by some of these entities could require us to incur
substantial costs or result in the temporary suspension of the operation of one or more of our ships or
lead to the invalidation of our insurance coverage reduction.

We believe that our ships operate in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and
regulations and that our ships in operation have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other
authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. In fact, each of our ships have an
ENVIRO, an ENVIRO+ or a CLEAN notation from our classification societies, which denote
compliance with their published guidelines concerning stringent criteria for environmental protection
related to design characteristics, management and support systems, sea discharges and air emissions.
Because environmental laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly strict
requirements, however, it is difficult to accurately predict the ultimate cost of complying with these
requirements or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our ships.
Moreover, additional legislation or regulation applicable to the operation of our ships that may be
implemented in the future could negatively affect our profitability.

**_International Maritime Regulations_**

The IMO, the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of pollution by ships,
has adopted several international conventions that regulate the international shipping industry,
including the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (‘‘SOLAS’’), the International
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention on Civil Liability
for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification
and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (‘‘STCW’’) and the International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution From Ships (‘‘MARPOL’’). Ships that transport gas, including LNG carriers, are also subject
to regulations under amendments to SOLAS, including the International Safety Management Code for
the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or the ‘‘ISM Code’’. The ISM Code requires,
among other things, that the party with operational control of a ship develop an extensive safety
management system, including the adoption of a policy for safety and environmental protection setting
forth instructions and procedures for operating its ships safely and also describing procedures for
responding to emergencies. We rely on GasLog LNG Services for the development and maintenance of
a safety management system for our ships that meets these requirements. The GasLog fleet is also
subject to the International Code for Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases
in Bulk (the ‘‘IGC Code’’), which prescribes design and construction standards for ships involved in the
transport of gas. Compliance with the IGC Code must be evidenced by a Certificate of Fitness for the
Carriage of Liquefied Gases of Bulk which is issued per vessel. Non-compliance with the IGC Code or
other applicable IMO regulations may subject a ship owner or a bareboat charterer to increased
liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected ships and may result in the
denial of access to, or detention in, some ports.

SOLAS is an international maritime law which sets minimum safety standards in the construction,
equipment and operation of merchant ships. The convention requires signatory flag states to ensure
that ships flagged by them comply with at least these standards. The current version of SOLAS is the
1974 version, known as SOLAS 1974, which came into force on May 25, 1980. As of January 2019,
SOLAS 1974 had 164 contracting states, which flag about 99% of merchant ships around the world in
terms of gross tonnage. SOLAS in its successive forms is generally regarded as the most important of
all international maritime laws concerning the safety of merchant ships.

STCW, 1978 was adopted on July 7, 1978 and entered into force on April 28, 1984. The main
purpose of the Convention is to promote safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the
marine environment by establishing in common agreement on international standards of training,

60


-----

certification and watchkeeping for seafarers. The Manila amendments to the STCW Convention and
Code were adopted on June 25, 2010, marking a major revision of the STCW Convention and Code.
The 2010 amendments entered into force on January 1, 2012 under the tacit acceptance procedure and
were aimed at bringing the Convention and Code up to date with developments since they were
initially adopted and to enable them to address issues that were anticipated to emerge in the
foreseeable future.

The MARPOL Convention establishes environmental standards relating to oil leakage or spilling,
garbage management, sewage, air emissions, handling and disposal of noxious liquids and the handling
of harmful substances in packaged form. In September 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL
to address air pollution from ships. Annex VI came into force on May 19, 2005. It sets limits on sulfur
oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone
depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur
content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur
emissions. Annex VI has been ratified by many, but not all, IMO member states. In October 2008, the
Marine Environment Protection Committee, or ‘‘MEPC’’, of the IMO approved amendments to
Annex VI regarding particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions standards. These
amendments became effective in July 2010. These requirements establish a series of progressive
standards to further limit the sulfur content in fuel oil, (which phased in between 2012 and 2020), as
well as new tiers of nitrogen oxide emission standards for new marine diesel engines, depending on
their date of installation. As of January 1, 2020, ships must either use low sulfur fuel oil (potentially
including undertaking necessary fuel tank modification) to comply with a global sulfur cap of
0.5 percent m/m or be fitted with exhaust gas scrubbers. Additionally, more stringent emission
standards could apply in coastal areas designated as Emission Control Areas, or ‘‘ECAs’’. For example,
IMO ‘‘Tier III’’ emission standards for nitrous oxide apply in North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea
ECAs to all marine diesel engines installed on a ship constructed on or after January 1, 2016. The
European Union Directive 2005/EC/33, which became effective on January 1, 2010, parallels Annex VI
and requires ships to use reduced sulfur content fuel for their main and auxiliary engines. Our owned
ships currently in operation comply with the relevant legislation and have the relevant certificates
including certificates evidencing compliance with Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention.

Although the United States is not a party, many countries have ratified the International
Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, or the ‘‘CLC’’. Under this
convention a ship’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial
waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject under certain circumstances to
certain defenses and limitations. Ships carrying more than 2,000 gross tons of oil, and trading to states
that are parties to this convention, must maintain evidence of insurance in an amount covering the
liability of the owner. In jurisdictions where the CLC has not been adopted, various legislative schemes
or common law impose liability either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to the CLC. P&I
Clubs in the International Group issue the required Bunker Convention (defined below) ‘‘Blue Cards’’
to provide evidence of insurance meeting the liability requirements. Where applicable, all of our vessels
have received ‘‘Blue Cards’’ from their P&I Club and are in possession of a CLC State-issued
certificate attesting that the required insurance coverage is in force.

The IMO also has adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil
Pollution Damage, or the ‘‘Bunker Convention’’, which imposes liability on ship owners for pollution
damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel and requires
registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an
amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime.
We maintain insurance in respect of our owned ships that satisfies these requirements. Non-compliance
with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject a shipowner or bareboat charterer to
increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected ships and may

61


-----

result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports, including ports in the United States and
Europe.

The Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 2006 was adopted by the International Labour
Conference at its 94th (Maritime) Session (2006), establishing minimum working and living conditions
for seafarers. The convention entered into force August 20, 2013, whilst amendments were approved by
the International Labour Conference at its 103rd Session (2014). The convention establishes a single,
coherent instrument embodying all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour
conventions and recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other
international labour conventions.

**_United States_**

_Oil Pollution Act and CERCLA_

Our operations are subject to the OPA, which establishes an extensive regulatory and liability
regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills, and the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or ‘‘CERCLA’’, which imposes liability on owners and
operators of ships for cleanup and natural resource damage from the release of hazardous substances
(other than oil). Under OPA, ship owners, operators and bareboat charterers are responsible parties
who are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a
third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages
arising from oil spills from their ships. As of November 12, 2019, OPA currently limits the liability of
responsible parties with respect to ships over 3,000 gross tons to the greater of $2,300 per gross ton or
$19,943,400 per double hull ship and permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with
regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Some states have enacted legislation
providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters. Liability under CERCLA
is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5.0 million for ships carrying a hazardous substance
as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $0.5 million for any other ship.

These limits of liability do not apply under certain circumstances, however, such as where the
incident is caused by violation of applicable U.S. Federal safety, construction or operating regulations,
or by the responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. In addition, a marine incident that
results in significant damage to the environment could result in amendments to these limitations or
other regulatory changes in the future. We maintain the maximum pollution liability coverage amount
of $1 billion per incident for our owned ships. We also believe that we will be in substantial compliance
with OPA, CERCLA and all applicable state regulations in the ports where our ships will call.

OPA also requires owners and operators of ships over 300 gross tons to establish and maintain
with the National Pollution Fund Center of the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility
sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability under the act. Such financial responsibility
can be demonstrated by providing a guarantee from an appropriate guarantor, who can release the
required guarantee to the National Pollution Fund Center against payment of the requested premium.
We have purchased such a guarantee in order to provide evidence of financial responsibility and have
received the mandatory certificates of financial responsibility from the U.S. Coast Guard in respect of
all of our delivered ships and we intend to obtain such certificates in the future for each of our vessels,
if they are required to have them.

_Clean Water Act_

The U.S. Clean Water Act of 1972, or ‘‘CWA’’, prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances
and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and
imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes
substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies

62


-----

available under OPA and CERCLA. Furthermore, most U.S. states that border a navigable waterway
have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and
damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be
more stringent than U.S. Federal law.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency, or ‘‘EPA’’, has enacted rules requiring ballast
water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain ships within United
States waters to be authorized under the Ship General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal
Operation of Ships, or the ‘‘VGP’’. To be covered by the VGP, owners of certain ships must submit a
Notice of Intent, or ‘‘NOI’’, at least 30 days before the ship operates in United States waters.
Compliance with the VGP could require the installation of equipment on our ships to treat ballast
water before it is discharged or the implementation of other disposal arrangements, and/or otherwise
restrict our ships from entering United States waters. In March 2013, the EPA published a new VGP
that includes numeric effluent limits for ballast water expressed as the maximum concentration of living
organisms in ballast water. The VGP also imposes a variety of changes for non-ballast water discharges
including more stringent Best Management Practices for discharges of oil-to-sea interfaces in an effort
to reduce the toxicity of oil leaked into U.S. waters. The 2013 VGP was issued with an effective period
of December 19, 2013 to December 18, 2018. The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, or ‘‘VIDA’’, enacted
on December 4, 2018, requires the EPA and Coast Guard to develop new performance standards and
enforcement regulations and extends the 2013 VGP provisions until new regulations are final and
enforceable. We have submitted NOIs for our fleet and intend to submit NOIs for our ships in the
future, where required, and do not believe that the costs associated with obtaining and complying with
the VGP will have a material impact on our operations.

_Clean Air Act_

The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 and 1990,
or the ‘‘CAA’’, requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic
compounds and other air contaminants. Our ships may be subject to vapor control and recovery
requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other
operations in regulated port areas and emission standards for so-called ‘‘Category 3’’ marine diesel
engines operating in U.S. waters. The marine diesel engine emission standards are currently limited to
new engines beginning with the 2004 model year. On April 30, 2010, the EPA adopted final emission
standards for Category 3 marine diesel engines equivalent to those adopted in the amendments to
Annex VI to MARPOL. However, our TFDE LNG carriers have the ability to burn natural gas as fuel
to power the ship, which can significantly reduce relevant emissions compared with steam-powered
ships.

The CAA also requires states to adopt State Implementation Plans, or ‘‘SIPs’’, designed to attain
national health-based air quality standards in primarily major metropolitan and/or industrial areas.
Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from ship loading and unloading operations by requiring the
installation of vapor control equipment. The MEPC has designated as an ECA the area extending
200 miles from the territorial sea baseline adjacent to the Atlantic/Gulf and Pacific coasts and the eight
main Hawaiian Islands and the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Caribbean Sea, under the Annex VI
amendments. Fuel used by vessels operating in the ECA cannot exceed 0.1% (mass by mass) sulfur. As
of January 1, 2016, NOx after-treatment requirements also apply. Our vessels can store and burn
low-sulfur fuel oil or alternatively burn natural gas which contains no sulfur. Additionally, burning
natural gas will ensure compliance with IMO Tier III NOx emission limitations without the need for
after-treatment. Charterers must supply compliant fuel for the vessels before ordering vessels to trade
in areas where restrictions apply. As a result, we do not expect such restrictions to have a materially
adverse impact on our operations or costs.

63


-----

**_Other Environmental Initiatives_**

U.S. Coast Guard regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, or ‘‘NISA’’,
impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all ships equipped with ballast water tanks
entering U.S. waters, which could require the installation of equipment on our ships to treat ballast
water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or
procedures, and/or otherwise restrict our ships from entering U.S. waters. In June 2012, the U.S. Coast
Guard rule establishing standards for the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water
discharged in U.S. waters and requiring the phase-in of Coast Guard approved ballast water
management systems, or ‘‘BWMS’’, became effective. The rule requires installation of Coast Guard
approved BWMS by new vessels constructed on or after December 1, 2013 and existing vessels as of
their first dry-docking after January 1, 2016. Several states have adopted legislation and regulations
relating to the permitting and management of ballast water discharges.

At the international level, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and
Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments in February 2004, or the ‘‘BWM Convention’’. The
BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water
exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits. The threshold
ratification requirements for the convention to enter into force were met in 2016, and the convention
became effective on September 8, 2017. All our newly delivered ships from 2016 onwards have
compliant equipment installed. We have selected one manufacturer to supply the required equipment
to be installed at the first dry-dock of all remaining ships. The programme and required funds have
been included in our future planning to ensure the fleet remains compliant at all times.

Our vessels may also become subject to the International Convention on Liability and
Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by
Sea, 1996 as amended by the Protocol to the HNS Convention, adopted in April 2010, or ‘‘HNS
Convention’’, if it is entered into force. The HNS Convention creates a regime of liability and
compensation for damage from hazardous and noxious substances, or ‘‘HNS’’, including a two-tier
system of compensation composed of compulsory insurance taken out by shipowners and an HNS Fund
which comes into play when the insurance is insufficient to satisfy a claim or does not cover the
incident. To date, the HNS Convention has not been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to
enter into force.

_Greenhouse Gas Regulations_

The MEPC of IMO adopted two new sets of mandatory requirements to address greenhouse gas
emissions from ships at its July 2011 meeting. The Energy Efficiency Design Index requires a minimum
energy efficiency level per capacity mile and is applicable to new vessels, and the Ship Energy
Efficiency Management Plan is applicable to currently operating vessels. The requirements, which
entered into force in January 2013, were fully implemented by GasLog as of December 31, 2012. The
IMO is also considering the development of a market-based mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions
from ships, but it is difficult to predict the likelihood that such a standard might be adopted or its
potential impact on our operations at this time.

The European Union has indicated in the past that it intends to propose an expansion of the
existing European Union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from
marine ships. The EU MRV Regulation (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification), entered into force on
July 1, 2015, requires large vessels entering European Union ports to monitor, report and verify their
carbon dioxide emissions as of January 1, 2018. In the United States, the EPA has adopted regulations
under the CAA to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources, although these
requirements do not currently apply to greenhouse gas emissions from ships. In addition, the IMO has
established a framework for reducing global greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by at least 40% by

64


-----

2030 and pursuing efforts towards 70% by 2050, compared to 2008 with the goal of holding the
increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit the
increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Although the Paris Agreement does not specifically require controls on
shipping or other industries, it is possible that countries or groups of countries will seek to impose such
controls in the future. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the
IMO, the European Union, the United States or other countries where we operate, or any treaty
adopted or amended at the international level that restricts emissions of greenhouse gases, could
require us to make significant expenditures that we cannot predict with certainty at this time.

We believe that LNG carriers, which have the inherent ability to burn natural gas to power the
ship, and in particular LNG carriers like certain of our vessels that utilize fuel-efficient diesel electric
and low pressure two-stroke propulsion, can be considered among the cleanest of large ships in terms
of emissions.

**_Ship Security Regulations_**

A number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years intended to enhance ship security.
On November 25, 2002, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or ‘‘MTSA’’, was signed into
law. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, the U.S. Coast Guard issued regulations in July 2003
requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard ships operating in waters subject
to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a
new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. This new chapter came into
effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on ships and port authorities, most
of which are contained in the newly created International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code, or
‘‘ISPS Code’’. Among the various requirements are:

-  on-board installation of automatic information systems to enhance ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore
communications;

-  on-board installation of ship security alert systems;

-  the development of ship security plans; and

-  compliance with flag state security certification requirements.

The U.S. Coast Guard regulations, intended to align with international maritime security
standards, exempt non-U.S. ships from MTSA ship security measures, provided such ships have on
board a valid ‘‘International Ship Security Certificate’’ that attests to the ship’s compliance with SOLAS
security requirements and the ISPS Code. We have implemented the various security measures required
by the IMO, SOLAS and the ISPS Code and have approved ISPS certificates and plans certified by the
applicable flag state on board all our ships.

**C. Organizational Structure**

GasLog is a holding company incorporated in Bermuda. As of March 2, 2020, it has 50 subsidiaries
which are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Bermuda, the Marshall Islands, the
United States, Singapore, Cyprus, Greece and England and Wales. Of our subsidiaries, 34 either own
vessels in our fleet or are parties to contracts to obtain newbuild vessels. Of our subsidiaries, 33 are
wholly owned by us and 17 are 35.6% owned by us. A list of our subsidiaries is set forth in Exhibit 8.1
to this annual report.

**D. Property, Plant and Equipment**

Other than our ships, we do not own any material property. Our vessels are subject to priority
mortgages, which secure our obligations under our various credit facilities. For information on our

65


-----

vessels, see ‘‘Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Our Fleet’’. For further
details regarding our credit facilities, refer to ‘‘Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—

We are an international owner, operator and manager of LNG carriers. As of March 2, 2020, our
wholly owned fleet consists of 19 LNG carriers, including 12 ships in operation and seven LNG carriers
on order at Samsung. GasLog is also the general and controlling partner in GasLog Partners, which
owns 15 LNG carriers, and GasLog has leased back for a period of up to 20 years one vessel sold to
Lepta Shipping in February 2016. We currently manage and operate 28 LNG carriers including 12 of
our wholly owned vessels in operation, 14 ships contributed or sold to the Partnership (the Solaris is
managed by a subsidiary of Shell), the bareboat vessel and one additional LNG carrier in which we
have a 25.0% interest. We are also supervising the construction of our newbuildings. We have secured
multi-year time charter contracts for eight of our operating ships, 13 of the 15 ships owned by the
Partnership, the bareboat vessel and our seven newbuildings on order, while six of our ships, including
one of the ships owned by the Partnership, are trading in the spot market. As of December 31, 2019,
our contracts are expected to provide total contracted revenue of $4.0 billion during their initial terms,
which expire between 2020 and 2032.

The additional LNG carrier in which we also have a 25.0% interest is the Methane Nile Eagle, a
2007-built LNG carrier owned by Egypt LNG and technically managed by us. It is currently operating
under a 20-year time charter to a subsidiary of Shell. The information about our owned fleet presented
in this report does not include our ownership interest in the Methane Nile Eagle.

We generate revenues by chartering our ships to customers on multi-year time charters and
short-term charters and by providing technical ship management services, including crewing, training,
maintenance, regulatory and classification compliance and HSSE management and reporting through
our wholly owned subsidiary GasLog LNG Services. The Group’s chief operating decision maker, being

operating segment.

**_Industry Overview and Trends_**

**_Energy Prices_**

As referenced in ‘‘Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors’’, oil prices, as measured by the spot
price of Brent crude oil, experienced continued volatility during 2019, trading within a range of
approximately $54 per barrel to $75 per barrel. During 2019, oil prices were supported by a relatively
strong global economy as well as continued production curbs from OPEC. These positive factors were
balanced by continued supply growth from non-OPEC producing countries. In early 2020, spot oil
prices have been under pressure, as financial markets speculate over the potential negative impact of
the COVID-19 virus outbreak on demand for oil and oil products. As of March 2, 2020 Brent crude oil
was quoted at approximately $51.9 per barrel compared to $66 per barrel at December 31, 2019 and at
the same time last year.

In contrast with global oil prices, global natural gas prices were under sustained pressure for most
of 2019. Natural gas prices in the import regions of Europe, as measured by the Title Transfer Facility
(‘‘TTF’’), averaged $4.3 per million British Thermal Units (‘‘MMBtu’’) in 2019 while in Asia, the Japan
Korea Marker (‘‘JKM’’) they averaged $6.1 per MMBtu. Both hit multi-year lows during the year.
Meanwhile, gas prices in the United States as measured by the Henry Hub (‘‘HH’’) benchmark,
averaged $2.6 per MMBtu and also reached multi-year lows during the summer. Global gas prices were
impacted by increasing gas production in export markets such as the United States, while a warmer
than average 2018/19 winter in the Northern Hemisphere, a warmer than average 2019/20 winter so far
and the start-up of new LNG export capacity during 2019 has pressured import prices in Europe and
Asia.

In early 2020, international gas prices have continued to fall due to weaker than normal winter
demand, high inventory levels in key demand regions and ample supply of LNG. The recent COVID-19
virus outbreak has also introduced uncertainty regarding demand for LNG over the near-term,
particularly in China. As of March 2, 2020, natural gas prices were quoted at approximately $2.6 per
MMBtu for TTF compared to $5.1 per MMBtu at the same time last year and at approximately
$3.3 per MMBtu for JKM compared to $6.6 per MMBtu at the same time last year. In the U.S., spot
Henry Hub natural gas prices have fallen to $1.8 per MMBtu as of March 2, 2020 compared to $3.2 at
the same time last year.

While the majority of LNG volumes are sold under long-term contracts with prices limited to the
price of crude oil, we believe that the difference in delivered gas prices between import markets in Asia
and the Atlantic Basin and export costs from the U.S., is a significant driver of spot LNG trade, as the
differential incentivizes natural gas marketers and buyers to ship LNG over longer distances. The
recent declines in Asian and European gas prices referenced above have resulted in a differential not
currently wide enough to incentivize inter-basin trade. However, gas price futures imply that the interbasin arbitrage opportunity may exist periodically in coming years, potentially leading to longer voyages
for LNG cargoes and, all else equal, increasing the demand for spot LNG shipping.

**_LNG Supply_**

According to Wood Mackenzie, the global seaborne trade of LNG was 364 million tonnes (‘‘mt’’)
in 2019, an increase of 12% over 2018. During the year, new production started in the United States
(Cameron Train 1, Corpus Christi LNG Train 2 and Freeport LNG Train 1) and Australia (Prelude).
Supply from existing liquefaction facilities in Australia, Russia, Nigeria and Abu Dhabi also increased
while downtime and/or underperformance at existing facilities in Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia and
Malaysia partially offset these gains. LNG supply is projected to rise 7% to approximately 391 mt in
2020, according to Wood Mackenzie. This expected growth is driven by the ramp-up of new supply
commissioned in 2019 and new capacity scheduled to come on stream in 2020.

67


-----

During 2019, six new LNG liquefaction projects with a combined capacity of approximately 71
mtpa reached Final Investment Decision (‘‘FID’’), a record year for the sanctioning of new LNG
projects and underpinning further LNG supply growth during the next decade. Projects which reached
FID include Golden Pass (16 mtpa), Calcasieu Pass (10 mtpa) and Sabine Pass Train 6 (4.5 mtpa) in
the United States, Mozambique LNG (12.9 mtpa) in Mozambique, Arctic LNG-2 (19.8 mtpa) in Russia
and Nigeria LNG Train 7 (8 mtpa including debottlenecking of existing trains) in Nigeria.

Wood Mackenzie anticipates at least another 50 mtpa of new LNG capacity will reach FID during
2020. Should any further projects take FID, incremental LNG shipping capacity is likely to be required
to transport the LNG produced by these projects. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that any of
these projects will take FID or, if one or more FIDs are taken, that incremental shipping will be
contracted or that GasLog will be successful in securing renewed or new charters at attractive rates and
durations to meet such LNG shipping requirements.

**_LNG Demand_**

According to Wood Mackenzie, LNG demand increased by 11%, to 351 mt in 2019 from 316 mt in
2018. European demand accounted for most of the growth, increasing by over 31 mt (61%)
year-over-year. European demand was driven by a combination of declining domestic production,
continued coal-to-gas switching for power generation and inventory restocking. In North Asia, demand
from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan declined by approximately 8 mt or 6%, while demand from China
increased by 7 mt or 13%.

During 2019, a significant number of long-term LNG off-take contracts were announced, a positive
indicator for future LNG demand. According to Wood Mackenzie, 85 mtpa of long-term (defined as
greater than 5 years duration) off-take commitments have been agreed since the beginning of 2019,
second only to the 95 mtpa signed in 2018.

Wood Mackenzie forecasts global LNG demand growth of over 90 mt between 2019 and 2025, a
compound annual growth of approximately 4%. This growth is expected to be broad-based, with
Southeast Asia (excluding India) accounting for approximately 46% and China, Latin America and
India expected to account for 27%, 11% and 10%, respectively.

**_LNG Shipping Rates and Chartering Activity_**

In the LNG shipping spot market, TFDE headline rates, as reported by Clarksons, averaged
$70,000 per day in 2019, a 23% decrease year-on-year . Low gas prices during much of 2019 limited the
arbitrage opportunity for transporting LNG between the Atlantic and Pacific basins. However, the
market balance tightened in the fourth quarter of 2019, as evidenced by the sharp increase in TFDE
headline rates to an annual peak of $140,000 per day in November, following a marked decrease in
spot ship availability. According to Poten, 57 term charters between six months and seven years were
reported in 2019, a decrease of 22% over 2018, of which 25 were for TFDE vessels and 12 were for
Steam vessels. The term charter market for Steam vessels continues to be significantly less liquid than
that for TFDEs.

Headline spot TFDE rates have fallen significantly from the peaks of the fourth quarter of 2019,
with Clarksons currently assessing headline spot rates for TFDE and Steam LNG carriers at $37,500
per day and $29,000 per day, respectively. Expected continued growth in LNG supply may support
LNG vessel demand in the second half of 2020 and into early 2021. However, the very weak current
prices and forward curves for natural gas in the key markets of North Asia and Europe could result in
shorter average voyage distances and lower shipping requirements. The recent COVID-19 virus
outbreak has also introduced uncertainty regarding near term demand for LNG, particularly in China.
In addition, spot rates may be prone to further periods of seasonality and volatility similar to those
seen in recent years. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that LNG shipping spot rates will stay at or

68


-----

near current levels or return to the levels experienced in the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2019, which
could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash
available for dividends to our shareholders.

Delays to the start-up, or unexpected downtime, of LNG supply projects or significant further
orders of new LNG carriers may weaken the supply/demand balance for LNG shipping. Reduced
demand for LNG or LNG shipping, or any reduction or limitation in LNG production capacity, or
significant increases in LNG shipping capacity, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
secure future time charters at attractive rates and durations for new ships we may order or acquire, or
upon expiration or early termination of our current charter arrangements, which could harm our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including cash available for dividends
to our shareholders, as well as our ability to meet certain of our debt covenants. A sustained decline in
charter rates could also adversely affect the market value of our ships, on which certain of the ratios
and financial covenants with which we are required to comply are based.

**_Global LNG Fleet_**

According to Poten, as of March 2, 2020, the global fleet of dedicated LNG carriers
(>100,000 cbm) consisted of 513 vessels with 118 LNG carriers on order, of which 76 vessels (or 63%)
have long-term charters. Poten estimates that a total of 41 LNG carriers are due to be delivered in
2020, with 15 of these in the first half of the year.

In 2019, 48 orders for LNG carriers were placed, as estimated by Poten. Newbuild ordering saw a
decline relative to 2018. We believe that the growing global demand for natural gas, especially in Asia,
increasing supply from the U.S. and other regions, and other LNG market trends, including increased
trading of LNG leading to transportation inefficiencies with cargoes spending more time on the water,
should support the existing order backlog for vessels and should also drive a need for additional LNG
carrier newbuildings. Finally, the scrapping of older and less efficient vessels, the conversion of existing
vessels to FSRUs or FSUs and/or employing LNG carriers for short-term storage purposes in order to
exploit arbitrage opportunities could reduce the availability of LNG carriers on the water today.
However, various factors, including changes in prices of and demand for LNG, can materially affect the
competitive dynamics that currently exist and there can be no assurance that this need for additional
carriers will materialize or that GasLog will be successful in securing renewed or new charters at
attractive rates and durations to meet such LNG shipping requirements.

The statements in this ‘‘Industry Overview and Trends’’ section are forward-looking statements
based on management’s current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance and outcomes to differ materially
from those expressed herein. See ‘‘Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors’’ of this annual report.

**A. Operating Results**

**Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

We believe the principal factors that will affect our future results of operations include:

-  the supply and demand for LNG shipping services and the number of vessels available in the
short-term or spot LNG carrier charter market;

-  the number of LNG carriers in our owned and managed fleets;

-  the timely delivery of our ships under construction;

-  our ability to obtain acceptable financing in respect of our capital and refinancing commitments;

69


-----

-  our ability to maintain good working relationships with our existing customers and our ability to
increase the number of our customers through the development of new working relationships;

-  the performance of our charterers;

-  the supply-demand relationship for LNG shipping services, including the impact of greater
competition in the LNG shipping market and the impact of the COVID-19 virus on demand for
LNG and LNG shipping;

-  our ability to employ the ships we own and the bareboat vessel, that currently do not have
charters at economically attractive rates;

-  the effective and efficient technical and operational management of our ships;

-  our ability to maintain the recruitment and retention of appropriately qualified seafarers and
shore staff;

-  our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and to satisfy technical, health, safety and
compliance standards that meet our customers’ requirements; and

-  economic, regulatory, political and governmental conditions that affect the LNG market and
LNG shipping industries, which include geopolitical factors such as the imposition of trade tariffs
and changes in the number of new LNG importing countries and regions, as well as structural
LNG market changes impacting LNG supply and demand.

In addition to the general factors discussed above, we believe certain specific factors have
impacted, or will impact, our results of operations. These factors include:

-  the hire rate earned by our owned ships, including any of our ships that may trade in the
short-term or spot market if we are unable to secure new term charters;

-  unscheduled off-hire days;

-  the fees we receive for technical ship management services;

-  the level of our ship operating expenses, including the costs of crewing, insurance and
maintenance;

-  our level of debt, the related interest expense and the timing of required payments of principal;

-  mark-to-market changes in derivative financial instruments and foreign currency fluctuations;
and

-  the level of our general and administrative expenses, including salaries and costs of consultants.

See ‘‘Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors’’ for a discussion of certain risks inherent in our
business.

**Principal Components of Revenues and Expenses**

**_Revenues_**

Our revenues are driven primarily by the number of LNG carriers in our owned fleet, the amount
of daily charter hire that they earn under time charters and the number of operating days during which
they generate revenues. These factors, in turn, are affected by our decisions relating to ship acquisitions
and disposals, the amount of time that our ships spend in dry-dock undergoing repairs, maintenance
and upgrade work, the age, condition and technical specifications of our ships as well as the relative
levels of supply and demand in the LNG carrier charter market. Under the terms of some of our time
charter arrangements, the operating cost component of the daily hire rate is intended to correspond to
the costs of operating the ship. Accordingly, we will receive additional revenue under certain of our

70


-----

time charters through an annual escalation of the operating cost component of the daily hire rate and,
in the event of more material increases in a ship’s operating costs, we may be entitled to receive
additional revenues under those charters. Under some of the other time charter arrangements, most of
our operating costs are passed-through to the charterer in the form of an adjustment to the operating
cost component of the daily hire rate. We believe these adjustment provisions provide substantial
protection against significant operating cost increases. See ‘‘Item 4. Information on the Company—
B. Business Overview—Ship Time Charters—Hire Rate Provisions’’ for a more detailed discussion of
the hire rate provisions of our charter contracts.

Our LNG carriers are employed through time charter or spot charter contracts. Following the exit
from the Cool Pool, management allocates revenues from time charters to two categories: (a) variable
rate charters and (b) fixed rate charters. The variable rate charter category contains vessels operating in
the LNG carrier spot and short-term market or those which have a variable rate of hire across the
charter period. The charter hire revenue is recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the term
of the relevant time charter starting from the vessel’s delivery to the charterer. Except for the off-hire
period, when a charter agreement exists, the vessel is made available and services are provided to the
charterer and collection of the related revenue is reasonably assured. Unearned revenue includes cash
received prior to the balance sheet date relating to services to be rendered after the balance sheet date.

The table below provides additional information about our contracted charter revenues based on
contracts in effect as of December 31, 2019 for (a) our wholly owned fleet, the 15 ships in the GasLog
Partners’ fleet, the bareboat vessel for which we have secured time charters and (b) our seven
newbuildings on order. Other than the assumptions reflected in the footnotes to the table, including
our assumption that our newbuildings are delivered on schedule, the table does not reflect events,
including charter party agreements signed or amended, occurring after December 31, 2019. The table
reflects only our contracted charter revenues for the ships in our owned fleet and bareboat fleet for
which we have secured time charters, and it does not reflect the costs or expenses we will incur in
fulfilling our obligations under the charters, nor does it include other revenues we may earn, such as
revenues for technical management of customer-owned ships. In particular, the table does not reflect
any revenues from any additional ships we may acquire in the future; nor does it reflect the options
under our time charters that permit our charterers to extend the time charter terms for successive
multi-year periods. The entry into new time charter contracts for the ships that are trading in the spot
market and any additional ships we may acquire, or the exercise of options extending the terms of our
existing charters, would result in an increase in the number of contracted days and the contracted
revenue for our fleet in the future. Although the contracted charter revenues are based on contracted
charter hire rate provisions, they reflect certain assumptions, including assumptions relating to future
ship operating costs. We consider the assumptions to be reasonable as of the date of this report, but if
these assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual time charter revenues could differ from those
reflected in the table. Furthermore, any contract is subject to various risks, including performance by
the counterparties or an early termination of the contract pursuant to its terms. If the charterers are
unable or unwilling to make charter payments to us, or if we agree to renegotiate charter terms at the
request of a charterer or if contracts are prematurely terminated for any reason, we would be exposed
to prevailing market conditions at the time and our results of operations and financial condition may
be materially adversely affected. Please see ‘‘Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors’’. For these
reasons, the contracted charter revenue information presented below is not fact and should not be
relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results and readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on this information. Neither the Company’s independent auditors, nor any other
independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the
information presented in the table, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance
on such information or its achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any
association with, the information in the table.

(1) Reflects time charter revenues and contracted days for our wholly owned ships, the 15 ships owned by the Partnership, the
bareboat vessel and seven newbuildings on order for which we have secured time charters. Does not include charter
revenues for the Methane Nile Eagle, in which we hold a 25.0% minority interest. Contracted revenue calculations assume:
(a) 365 revenue days per annum, with 30 off-hire days when the ship undergoes scheduled dry-docking (every five years);
(b) all LNG carriers on order are delivered on schedule; and (c) no exercise of any option to extend the terms of charters.
For time charters that give the charterer the option to set the charter hire rate at prevailing market rates during an initial
portion of the time charter’s term, revenue calculations assume that the charterer does not elect such option. Revenue
calculations for such charters include an estimate of the amount of the operating cost component and the management fee
component. For time charters that are based on a variable rate of hire within an agreed range during the charter period,
the lower end of the range is used for this calculation.

(2) Available days represent total calendar days after deducting 30 off-hire days when the ship undergoes scheduled
dry-docking. The available days for the ships trading in the spot/short-term market are included.

(3) Represents available days for ships after the expiration of existing charters (assuming charterers do not exercise any option
to extend the terms of the charters) and the available days for the vessels trading in the spot/short-term market.

The revenues of GasLog LNG Services, our wholly owned subsidiary, are driven primarily by the
number of ships operating under our technical management and the amount of the fees we earn for
each of these ships as well as the amount of fees that we may earn for plan approval and construction
supervision of newbuilding LNG carriers. In addition to revenues from external customers, GasLog
LNG Services receives revenues for technical management, plan approval and construction supervision
services provided to our owned fleet, which are eliminated on consolidation.

Revenue from vessel management and vessel construction project supervision contracts is
recognized when earned and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and such a benefit can be measured reliably.

**_Net Pool Allocation_**

In relation to the vessels participating in the Cool Pool (until July 2019, when GasLog exited the
Cool Pool), net pool allocation represents GasLog’s share of the net revenues earned from the other
pool participants’ vessels less the other participants’ share of the net revenues earned by GasLog’s
vessels included in the pool. Each participant’s share of the net pool revenues is based on the number
of pool points attributable to its vessels and the number of days such vessels participated in the pool.

**_Voyage Expenses and Commissions_**

Under our time charter arrangements, charterers bear substantially all voyage expenses, including
bunker fuel, port charges and canal tolls, but not commissions, which we have historically paid to
unaffiliated ship brokers based on a flat fee per ship. Commissions are recognized as expenses on a pro
rata basis over the duration of the period of the time charter.

Vessel operating costs and voyage expenses and commissions are expensed as incurred, with the
exception of commissions, which are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the duration of the period of

72


-----

the time charter. Bunkers consumption represents mainly bunkers consumed during vessels’
unemployment and off-hire.

**_Vessel Operating and Supervision Costs_**

We are generally responsible for ship operating expenses, which include costs for crewing,
insurance, repairs, modifications and maintenance, including dry-docking, lubricants, spare parts and
consumable stores and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as the associated cost of providing these
items and services. However, as described above, the hire rate provisions of our time charters are
intended to reflect the operating costs borne by us. Certain of our charters contain provisions that
significantly reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs, including review provisions and cost
pass-through provisions. Ship operating expenses are recognized as expenses when incurred.

In addition, we pay fees to GasLog LNG Services in connection with our own newbuildings on
order for plan approval and construction supervision services provided by GasLog LNG Services and to
cover third-party expenses incurred by GasLog LNG Services in respect of the newbuildings. These
fees, other than any intercompany profit, are capitalized as part of the asset value of our ships. The
fees paid for technical ship management services, which are considered vessel operating and supervision
costs of our owned fleet (and corresponding revenues of GasLog LNG Services), are eliminated on
consolidation.

Vessel operating and supervision costs of GasLog LNG Services include staff costs, such as
salaries, social security and training for the technical management team and project specialists, and
project-related expenses.

**_Depreciation_**

The majority of our consolidated depreciation expenses relate to the cost of our ships. We
depreciate the cost of our ships on the basis of two components: a vessel component and a dry-docking
component. The vessel component is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life
of each ship, based on the cost of the ship less its estimated residual value. We estimate the useful lives
of our ships to be 35 years from the date of delivery from the shipyard. Secondhand vessels are
depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their remaining estimated useful life.
Management estimates residual value of its vessels to be equal to the product of its lightweight tonnage
(‘‘LWT’’), and an estimated scrap rate per LWT, which represents our estimate of the market value of
the ship at the end of its useful life. We review scrap rates on an annual basis.

We must periodically dry-dock each of our ships for inspection, repairs and maintenance and any
modifications to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. All our ships are
required to be dry-docked for these inspections at least once every five years. At the time of delivery of
a ship, we estimate the dry-docking component of the cost of the ship, which represents the estimated
cost of the ship’s first dry-docking based on our historical experience with similar types of ships. The
dry-docking component of the ship’s cost is depreciated over five years, in case of new ships, and until
the next dry-docking for secondhand ships, which is performed within five years from the vessel’s last
dry-docking unless we determine to dry-dock the ships at an earlier date. In the event a ship is
dry-docked at an earlier date, the unamortized dry-docking component is written off immediately.

**_General and Administrative Expenses_**

General and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs for administrative and
support staff, board of directors fees, expense recognized in connection with share-based compensation,
rent, utilities, travel expenses, legal expenses, information and computing equipment and services, other
professional services and consultants, training for crew familiarization and other advisor costs.

73


-----

**_Impairment Loss on Vessels_**

All vessels are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Whenever the carrying amount of a vessel
exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of
profit or loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of a vessel’s fair value less cost of disposal and
‘‘value in use’’. The fair value less cost of disposal is the amount obtainable from the sale of a vessel in
an arm’s length transaction less the costs of disposal, while ‘‘value in use’’ is the present value of
estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of a vessel and from its disposal
at the end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual vessels. Each vessel is
considered to be a single cash-generating unit. The fair value less cost of disposal of the vessels is
estimated from market-based evidence by appraisal that is normally undertaken by professionally
qualified brokers.

**_Financial Costs_**

We incur interest expense on the outstanding indebtedness under our existing credit facilities,
bonds and our swap arrangements that qualify for treatment as cash flow hedges for financial reporting
purposes, which we include in our financial costs. Financial costs also include amortization of other
loan issuance costs incurred in connection with establishing our credit facilities. We will incur additional
interest expense and other borrowing costs in the future on our outstanding borrowings and under the
undrawn or future borrowings and commitments. For a description of our credit facilities, including our
loan agreements, see ‘‘Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Credit Facilities’’.

Interest expense and the amortization of loan issuance costs that relate directly to a specific loan
to finance an LNG carrier under construction and are incurred during the construction period are
capitalized as part of the cost of the ship. Otherwise, interest expense and amortization of loan
issuance costs are expensed as incurred.

**_Financial Income_**

Financial income consists of interest income, which will depend on the level of our cash deposits,
investments and prevailing interest rates. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis.

**_(Loss)/Gain on Derivatives_**

(Loss)/gain on derivatives consist of the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had an average of 27.2 ships operating in our
owned and bareboat fleet (including ships owned by the Partnership), having 9,518 revenue operating
days and an average of 27.2 ships operating under our technical management (including 27.0 of our
owned and bareboat ships). During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had an average of 26.0 ships
operating in our owned and bareboat fleet (including ships owned by the Partnership), having 9,030
revenue operating days and an average of 25.5 ships operating under our technical management
(including 25.0 of our owned and bareboat ships).

**_Revenues:_** Revenues increased by 8.1%, or $50.3 million, from $618.3 million during the year
ended December 31, 2018 to $668.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in
revenues is mainly attributable to an increase of $63.4 million deriving from the full operation of the
_GasLog Houston, the_ _GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Gladstone which were delivered on_
January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively and the deliveries of the GasLog
_Gladstone on March 15, 2019 and the_ _GasLog Warsaw on July 31, 2019. These deliveries resulted in an_
increase in revenue operating days. In addition, there was an increase of $11.0 million from our vessels
trading in the spot and short-term market including the impact of the unscheduled dry-dockings of the
_GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Singapore and the GasLog Chelsea and an increase of $2.7 million from_
the remaining fleet. The above increases were partially offset by a decrease of $26.1 million from the
expiration of the initial time charters of the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog Santiago, the GasLog Sydney,
the GasLog Skagen, the GasLog Saratoga and the Methane Jane Elizabeth and a decrease of $0.7 million
due to increased off-hire days from the remaining vessels. The average daily hire rate increased from
$68,392 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $70,167 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**_Net Pool Allocation:_** Net pool allocation decreased by $22.1 million, from a positive $17.8 million
during the year ended December 31, 2018 to a negative $4.3 million during the year ended
December 31, 2019. The decrease in net pool allocation was attributable to the movement in the

adjustment of the net pool results generated by the GasLog vessels in accordance with the pool
distribution formula for the total fleet of the pool, as well as GasLog’s vessels exiting the Cool Pool in
June and July 2019. GasLog recognized gross revenues and gross voyage expenses and commissions of
$45.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively, from the operation of its vessels in the Cool Pool during
the year ended December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: $102.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively).
GasLog’s total net pool performance is presented below:

**GasLog’s total net pool performance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **109,917** **32,903**

**_Voyage Expenses and Commissions:_** Voyage expenses and commissions increased by 16.7%, or
$3.4 million, from $20.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $23.8 million during the
year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in voyage expenses and commissions is mainly attributable
to an increase of $3.4 million in bunkers and voyage expenses consumed during certain unchartered
and off-hire periods for the vessels trading in the spot market.

**_Vessel Operating and Supervision Costs:_** Vessel operating and supervision costs increased by 9.1%,
or $11.6 million, from $128.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $139.7 million during
the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in vessel operating and supervision costs is primarily
attributable to the increase in ownership days due to the deliveries of the GasLog Gladstone and the
_GasLog Warsaw on March 15, 2019 and July 31, 2019, respectively and the full operation of the GasLog_
_Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the_ _GasLog Genoa which were delivered on January 8, 2018,_
March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively, the increase in scheduled technical and maintenance
costs related to engine maintenance and costs related to dry-dockings, including expenses associated
with the preparation for compliance with the IMO 2020 regulations and the increase in insurance costs.
The above increases were partially offset by the favorable movement of the EUR/USD exchange rate.
Daily operating costs per vessel increased from $14,306 per ownership day (as defined below) for the
year ended December 31, 2018 to $14,595 per ownership day (as defined below) for the year ended
December 31, 2019. Ownership days represent total calendar days for our owned and bareboat fleet.

**_Depreciation:_** Depreciation increased by 9.7%, or $14.8 million, from $153.2 million during the
year ended December 31, 2018 to $168.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The
increase in depreciation resulted mainly from the delivery of the GasLog Gladstone on March 15, 2019
and the GasLog Warsaw on July 31, 2019, the full operation in the year ending December 31, 2019 of
the GasLog Houston, the GasLog Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa following their delivery on
January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and March 29, 2018, respectively, and the increase from the
depreciation of the right-of-use assets deriving from the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases.

**_General and Administrative Expenses:_** General and administrative expenses increased by 12.9%, or
$5.4 million, from $42.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $47.4 million during the
year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly
attributable to restructuring costs of $4.7 million that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2019. Daily
general and administrative expenses per vessel excluding the effect of the restructuring costs decreased

-----

from $4,507 per ownership day (as defined above) for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $4,297 per
ownership day (as defined above) for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**_Impairment Loss on Vessels:_** Impairment loss on vessels was nil for the year ended December 31,
2018 and $162.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The impairment loss was recognized
with respect to the Partnership’s Steam vessels (the Methane Rita Andrea, the Methane Jane Elizabeth,
the Methane Alison Victoria, the Methane Shirley Elisabeth and the Methane Heather Sally) and the
Steam vessel owned by GasLog (the Methane Lydon Volney), as a result of the impairment assessment
performed by the Group for the entire fleet after concluding that events and circumstances triggered
the existence of potential impairment of its vessels as of December 31, 2019.

**_Financial Costs:_** Financial costs increased by 14.3%, or $23.9 million, from $166.6 million during
the year ended December 31, 2018 to $190.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The
increase in financial costs is attributable to an increase of $15.8 million in interest expense on loans,
bonds and cash flow hedges, an increase of $4.4 million in other financial costs mainly due to the
unrealized foreign exchange losses on cash and bond, an increase of $2.1 million in loss arising on bond
repurchases at premium and an increase of $1.6 million deriving mainly from the write-off of fees
relating to the old Partnership facility. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we had an average
of $3,072.0 of outstanding indebtedness, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%, while during the
year ended December 31, 2018, we had an average of $2,886.3 million of outstanding indebtedness,
with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%. These weighted average interest rates include interest
expense on loans and cash flow hedges and interest expense on bonds and CCSs.

**_Loss on Derivatives:_** Loss on derivatives increased by $49.3 million, from a loss of $6.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 to a loss of $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $46.1 million in the loss from mark-to-market
valuation of our derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss, which
reflected a loss of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to a loss of
$54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.9 million in realized gain on
forward foreign exchange contracts held for trading and an increase of $0.7 million in recycled loss of
cash flow hedges reclassified to profit or loss, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in realized
gain from interest rate swaps held for trading and a decrease of $0.1 million in the ineffective portion
of cash flow hedges.

**_Profit/(Loss) for the Year:_** Profit for the year decreased by $242.0 million, from a profit of
$126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a loss of $115.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 as a result of the aforementioned factors.

**_Profit/(Loss) Attributable to Owners of the Group:_** Profit Attributable to Owners of the Group
decreased by $148.4 million, from a profit of $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to a
loss of $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profit to loss attributable
to the owners of GasLog resulted mainly from the respective movements in profit mentioned above.

end of ocr table
increase in net pool allocation was attributable to the movement in the adjustment of the net pool
results earned by the GasLog vessels in accordance with the pool distribution formula. GasLog
recognized gross revenues and gross voyage expenses and commissions of $102.3 million and
$10.2 million, respectively, from the operation of its vessels in the Cool Pool during the year ended
December 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017: $38.0 million and $9.1 million, respectively). The increase in
GasLog’s total net pool performance was driven by higher spot rates and higher utilization achieved by
all vessels trading in the Cool Pool. GasLog’s total net pool performance is presented below:

**For the year ended**
**2017** **2018**

**_Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars_**

**GasLog’s total net pool performance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **36,178** **109,917**

**_Voyage Expenses and Commissions:_** Voyage expenses and commissions increased by 32.5%, or
$5.0 million, from $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $20.4 million during the
year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in voyage expenses and commissions is mainly attributable
to an increase of $3.6 million in bunkers consumed and voyage expenses during certain unchartered
and off-hire periods, an increase of $0.3 million in voyage expenses of the vessels operating in the spot
market and an increase of $1.1 million in brokers’ commissions.

**_Vessel Operating and Supervision Costs:_** Vessel operating and supervision costs increased by 4.6%,
or $5.6 million, from $122.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $128.1 million during
the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in vessel operating and supervision costs is primarily
attributable to the increase in ownership days due to the deliveries of the GasLog Houston, the GasLog
_Hong Kong and the GasLog Genoa (which were delivered on January 8, 2018, March 20, 2018 and_
March 29, 2018, respectively), which caused an increase in crew costs, partially offset by a decrease in
taxes. The average daily operating cost per vessel decreased from $15,254 per day in 2017 to $14,306
per day in 2018.

**_Depreciation:_** Depreciation increased by 11.7%, or $16.0 million, from $137.2 million during the
year ended December 31, 2017 to $153.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The
increase in depreciation resulted mainly from the increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet
in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.

**_General and Administrative Expenses:_** General and administrative expenses increased by 5.3%, or
$2.1 million, from $39.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $42.0 million during the
year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly
attributable to an increase of $2.2 million in employee costs mainly due to the unfavorable movement
of the United States Dollar (‘‘USD’’) against the Euro (‘‘EUR’’) and the British Pound (we have
entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge economically part of this exposure and the
associated realized gains are recorded in Gain/(loss) on derivatives, which is discussed below). Daily
general and administrative expenses per vessel decreased from $4,747 per ownership day (as defined
above) for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $4,507 per ownership day (as defined above) for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

**_Financial Costs:_** Financial costs increased by 19.7%, or $27.4 million, from $139.2 million during
the year ended December 31, 2017 to $166.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The

79


-----

increase in financial costs is attributable to an increase of $28.7 million in interest expense on loans,
bonds and cash flow hedges, an increase of $0.3 million in the other financial costs and an increase of
$0.2 million in the amortization of deferred loan issuance costs. The above increases were partially
offset by a decrease of $1.5 million in losses arising upon the repurchase in 2017 of the NOK
denominated bonds at a premium and a decrease of $0.3 million in finance lease charges. During the
year ended December 31, 2018, we had an average of $2,886.3 million of outstanding indebtedness,
with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, we had
an average of $2,688.2 million of outstanding indebtedness, with a weighted average interest rate of
4.1%. These weighted average interest rates include interest expense on loans and cash flow hedges
and interest expense on bonds and CCSs.

**_(Gain)/loss on Derivatives:_** Gain on derivatives decreased by $8.1 million, from a gain of
$2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018. The decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease of $18.5 million in the gain from
mark-to-market valuation of our derivative financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or
loss and an increase of $0.2 million in the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, partially offset by a
decrease of $6.2 million in realized loss from derivative financial instruments held for trading and a
decrease of $4.4 million in loss that was reclassified from equity to the statement of profit or loss.

**_Profit for the Year:_** Profit increased by 50.1%, or $42.2 million, from $84.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017 to $126.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of the
aforementioned factors.

**_Profit/(Loss) Attributable to Owners of the Group:_** Profit Attributable to Owners of the Group
increased by $32.2 million, from a profit of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a
profit of $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in profit attributable to the
owners of GasLog resulted from the increase in profit mentioned above, partially offset by the increase
in profit attributable to the non-controlling interests (non-controlling unitholders of GasLog Partners)
as a result of the issuances under the GasLog Partners’ ATM Programme, the preference unit issuances
in January 2018 and November 2018 and the sale of three vessels to GasLog Partners in 2017 and
another two vessels in 2018.

**Customers**

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we received 70.0% of our revenues from Shell, 15.7% of
our revenues from various charterers in the spot/short-term market, 14.2% from major LNG producers
and 0.1% of our revenues from Egypt LNG. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received
74.2% of our revenues from Shell, 16.5% of our revenues from various charterers in the spot/
short-term market, 9.2% from major LNG producers and 0.1% of our revenues from Egypt LNG.

**Seasonality**

While our owned and bareboat ships are mainly employed under multi-year, fixed-rate charter
arrangements, seasonal trends do impact the revenues earned during the year by our vessels trading in
the spot and short-term market and under variable rate charters. In recent years, there has been a
significant increase in the seasonality of LNG shipping spot rates with relative strength during the
months of September through January and relative weakness during the months of March through
May.

Additionally, our business is not subject to seasonal borrowing requirements.

**B. Liquidity and Capital Resources**

As of December 31, 2019, GasLog has financed its capital requirements with contributions from its
pre-IPO shareholders, proceeds from our IPO and the GasLog Partners’ IPO, proceeds from the 2014,
2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 follow-on common and preference equity offerings by GasLog and GasLog
Partners, the 2017 and 2019 follow-on debt offerings and the private placements, operating cash flows
and long-term financings including bank loans and bond offerings. Our primary liquidity needs are to
fund our ship-operating and general and administrative expenses, finance the purchase and construction
of our newbuildings, purchase secondhand vessels, maintain our on-the-water vessels, service our
existing debt and pay dividends. In monitoring our working capital needs, we project our charter hire
income and ships’ maintenance and running expenses, as well as debt service obligations, and seek to
maintain adequate cash reserves in order to address any budget overruns, if any.

We anticipate that our primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash from operations and
borrowings under existing and new loan agreements. We may seek to raise additional common or other
forms of equity, subject in each case to market conditions. We believe that these sources of funds will
be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to
obtain future debt and equity financing on terms acceptable to us.

Our funding and treasury activities are intended to provide return of capital while balancing
investment returns in order to maintain appropriate liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are held
primarily in U.S. dollars.

As of December 31, 2019, we had $263.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which
$149.5 million was held in time deposits and $0.6 million was held in ship management client accounts.
The funds in the ship management client accounts were held on behalf of customers of GasLog LNG
Services in order to cover obligations of third party vessels under management. Moreover, as of
December 31, 2019, GasLog had $4.5 million held in time deposits with an initial duration of more
than three months but less than a year that have been classified as short-term investments.

Additionally, there was an undrawn amount of $100.0 million under the revolving credit facility of
the Legacy Facility Refinancing and $2.0 million under the 2019 GasLog Partnership Facility.

As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of $3.1 billion of indebtedness outstanding under
our credit agreements and bonds, of which $255.4 million was repayable within one year, and a
$204.9 million lease liability related to the sale and leaseback of the Methane Julia Louise, of which
$9.4 million was repayable within one year.

We have entered into three CCSs to exchange interest payments and principal on maturity on the
same terms as the NOK 2024 Bonds and designated the CCSs as hedges of the variability of the USD
functional currency equivalent cash flows on the NOK 2024 Bonds. Refer to Note 26 to our audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for details on our derivative
arrangements.

The total contract price for our seven newbuildings on order as of December 31, 2019 is
approximately $1.3 billion, of which $185.1 million was paid as of December 31, 2019. The balance is
payable under each shipbuilding contract in installments upon the attainment of certain specified
milestones, with the largest portion of the purchase price for each ship coming due upon its delivery.
We are scheduled to take delivery of these newbuildings on various dates in 2020 and 2021. As of
December 31, 2019, the total remaining balance of the contract prices for the seven newbuildings was
$1.1 billion, of which $801.8 million is due within 12 months which will be funded with existing
undrawn debt including the $1,052.8 million under the 7xNB Facility signed December 12, 2019,
available cash, cash from operations and other financings we may enter into.

On May 16, 2017, GasLog Partners commenced its ATM Programme under which the Partnership
may, from time to time, raise equity through the issuance and sale of new common units having an
aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million in accordance with the terms of an equity distribution
agreement (the ‘‘Equity Distribution Agreement’’) entered into on the same date. Citigroup Global
Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC agreed to act as sales agents. On November 3, 2017, the Partnership
entered into the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution Agreement to increase the size of the
ATM Programme to $144.0 million and to include UBS Securities LLC as a sales agent. On
February 26, 2019, the Partnership entered into a Third Amended and Restated Equity Distribution
Agreement to further increase the size of the ATM Programme from $144.0 million to $250.0 million.

No issuances of common units were made under the ATM Programme in 2019. From
establishment of the ATM Programme through December 31, 2019, GasLog Partners issued and
received payment for 5,291,304 common units at a weighted average price of $23.33 per common unit
for total gross proceeds of $123.4 million and total net proceeds of $121.2 million. In connection with
the issuance of common units under the ATM Programme during this period, the Partnership also
issued 107,987 general partner units to its general partner in order for GasLog to retain its 2.0%
general partner interest. The net proceeds from the issuance of the general partner units were
$2.5 million.

On January 5, 2018, GasLog prepaid the remaining $29.8 million of the Five Vessel Refinancing
which would have been originally due in April 2018. The prepaid debt was associated with the Junior
Tranche of the Five Vessel Refinancing, which was terminated on January 5, 2018.

On January 17, 2018, the Partnership completed a public offering of 4,600,000 of its 8.200%
Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate Preference Units (the ‘‘Partnership’s
Series B Preference Units’’) (including 600,000 units issued upon the exercise in full by the
underwriters of their option to purchase additional Partnership’s Series B Preference Units), liquidation
preference $25.00 per unit, at a price to the public of $25.00 per preference unit. The net proceeds
from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses were
$111.2 million. The Partnership’s Series B Preference Units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol
‘‘GLOP PR B’’.

On March 23, 2018, the Partnership prepaid and terminated the $45.0 million term loan provided
by GasLog under the New Sponsor Facility, which would have been due in March 2022.

On November 15, 2018, the Partnership completed a public offering of 4,000,000 8.500% Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate Preference Units (the ‘‘Partnerships’
Series C Preference Units’’), liquidation preference $25.00 per unit, at a price to the public of $25.00
per preference unit. The net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and other offering expenses were $96.3 million. The Partnership’s Series C Preference
Units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘‘GLOP PR C’’.On January 29,
2019, the board of directors of GasLog Partners authorized a unit repurchase programme of up to
$25.0 million covering the period from January 31, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Under the terms of the
repurchase programme, GasLog Partners may repurchase common units from time to time, at its
discretion, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. In the year ended December 31,
2019, GasLog Partners repurchased and cancelled 1,171,572 of the Partnership’s common units at a
weighted average price of $19.52 per common unit for a total amount of $22.9 million, including
commissions.

On February 20, 2019, the Partnership entered into a credit agreement with Credit Suisse AG,
Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Norge (‘‘Nordea’’) and Iyo Bank, Ltd., Singapore Branch, each an original
lender and Nordea acting as security agent and trustee for and on behalf of the other finance parties
mentioned above, of up to $450.0 million (the ‘‘2019 Partnership Facility’’), in order to refinance the

82


-----

existing indebtedness due in November 2019 on five of its vessels. Subsequently, on the same date, the
Development Bank of Japan, Inc., entered the facility as lender via a transfer certificate. The
agreement provides for an amortizing revolving credit facility which can be repaid and redrawn at any
time for a period of five years. The total available facility amount will be reduced on a quarterly basis,
with a final balloon amount payable concurrently with the last quarterly installment, if any, in February
2024. The vessels covered by the 2019 Partnership Facility are the GasLog Shanghai, the GasLog
_Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the Methane Rita Andrea and the Methane Jane Elizabeth. Interest on the_
2019 Partnership Facility is payable at a rate of U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘LIBOR’’)
plus a margin.

On March 6, 2019, the Partnership drew down $360.0 million under the 2019 Partnership Facility,
out of which $354.4 million was used to refinance the outstanding debt of GAS-three Ltd., GASfour Ltd., GAS-five Ltd., GAS-sixteen Ltd. and GAS-seventeen Ltd., which would have been due in
November 2019. On April 1, 2019, the Partnership drew down an additional $75.0 million under the
2019 Partnership Facility.

On May 16, 2019, GasLog closed a follow-on issue of $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of
the 8.875% Senior Notes priced at 102.5% of par with a yield to maturity of 7.89%. The gross proceeds
from this offering were $76.9 million, including a $1.9 million premium, while the net proceeds, after
deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $75.4 million.

On June 25, 2019, GasLog Hellas-1 Special Maritime Enterprise entered into a loan agreement
with ABN AMRO BANK N.V. and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, for the financing of
the GasLog Warsaw, which was delivered on July 31, 2019 (the ‘‘GasLog Warsaw Facility’’). The
agreement provides for a single tranche of $129.5 million that was drawn on July 25, 2019 and is
repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments of $1.6 million each and a final balloon payment of
$84.2 million payable concurrently with the last quarterly installment in June 2026. The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

On November 21, 2019, GasLog completed the issuance of NOK 900.0 million (equivalent to
$98.6 million) of NOK 2024 Bonds in the Norwegian bond market. The NOK 2024 Bonds mature in
November 2024 and have a coupon of 6.25% over the three-month Norwegian Interbank Offered Rate
(‘‘NIBOR’’). The proceeds from the issuance were used in part to repurchase and cancel NOK 316.0
million (or $34.6 million) of the outstanding NOK 2021 Bonds at a price of 104.75% of par value. The
outstanding balance of the NOK 2021 Bonds, after the partial repurchase, amounted to NOK
434.0 million (equivalent to $49.2 million). On January 31, 2020, GasLog completed the repurchase of
the outstanding balance of the NOK 2021 Bonds at a price of 104.0% of par value plus accrued
interest, for a total consideration of NOK 451.4 million ($54.4 million). In addition, GasLog paid
$10.5 million for the partial exchange of the outstanding 8.875% Senior Notes at a price of 104.75% of
par value. The exchange was completed in January 13, 2020.

On December 12, 2019, GAS-twenty eight Ltd., GAS-thirty Ltd., GAS-thirty one Ltd., GAS-thirty
two Ltd., GAS-thirty three Ltd., GAS-thirty four Ltd. and GAS-thirty five Ltd. entered into a loan
agreement with 13 international banks, with Citibank N.A. London Branch and DNB Bank ASA,
London Branch acting as agents on behalf of the other finance parties. The financing is backed by the
Export Import Bank of Korea (‘‘KEXIM’’) and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (‘‘K-Sure’’),
who are either directly lending or providing cover for over 60% of the facility. The agreement of up to
$1,052.8 million partially finances the delivery of seven newbuilds scheduled to be delivered in 2020 and
2021. The loan bears interest plus a margin.

In December 2019, GasLog achieved improvements to the financial and non-financial covenants
across the entirety of its bank debt, most notably decreasing minimum liquidity requirements from
3.0% of total indebtedness, or 4% if dividends are paid, to a flat amount of $75.0 million which will be
applicable upon repayment of our U.S. dollar bonds maturing in March 2022, which have a minimum

83


-----

liquidity requirement of 2.5% of total indebtedness. The covenants are now aligned with the terms of
the 7xNB Facility and the GasLog Warsaw facility concluded earlier in 2019.

As our fleet expands, we will evaluate changes to the quarterly dividend consistent with our cash
flow and liquidity position. Our policy is to pay dividends in amounts that will allow us to retain
sufficient liquidity to fund our obligations as well as to execute our business plan going forward. Our
board of directors will determine the timing and amount of all dividend payments, based on various
factors, including our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, restrictions in
our credit facilities and the provisions of Bermuda law. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will
be able to pay quarterly dividends. See ‘‘Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Item 8.
Financial Information—A. Consolidated Financial Statements and Other Financial Information—
Common Shares Dividend Policy’’ for a discussion of risks related to our ability to pay dividends.

**Working Capital Position**

We anticipate that our primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash from operations and
borrowings under existing and new loan agreements. We may seek to raise additional common or other
forms of equity. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to fund our operations,
including our working capital requirements, and to make the required principal and interest payments
on our indebtedness during the next 12 months; however, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to obtain future debt and equity financing on terms acceptable to us.

As of December 31, 2019, our current assets totaled $315.8 million while current liabilities totaled
$437.5 million, resulting in a negative working capital position of $121.7 million.

**Cash Flows**

**_Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019_**

The following table summarizes our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing
activities for the years indicated:

**Year ended December 31,**
**2018** **2019** **Change**

**Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars**
Net cash provided by operating activities . . . . . . $ 283,710 $ 317,423 $ 33,713
Net cash used in investing activities . . . . . . . . . . (692,999) (442,978) 250,021
Net cash provided by financing activities . . . . . . 368,120 50,066 (318,054)

_Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities_

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $33.7 million, from $283.7 million during the
year ended December 31, 2018 to $317.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The
increase was attributable to an increase of $57.7 million caused by movements in working capital
accounts due primarily to (a) increased cash from related parties of $56.3 million (mainly collection of
Cool Pool receivables), (b) an increase of $20.3 million from movements in other payables and accruals,
and (c) an increase of $4.6 million from movements in trade and other receivables, partially offset by
an increase in cash collateral on swaps of $22.2 million, an increase of $28.2 million in total revenues
(revenues and net pool allocation), partially offset by a decrease of $29.9 million in cash paid for
interest including the interest paid for finance leases and a net decrease of $22.3 million from the
remaining movements.

_Net Cash Used In Investing Activities_

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $250.0 million, from $693.0 million during the
year ended December 31, 2018 to $443.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The
decrease is attributable to a decrease of $203.7 million in net cash used in payments for the
construction costs of newbuildings and other fixed assets, a net increase of $45.5 million in cash from
short-term investments in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period of 2018
and an increase of $0.8 million in cash from interest income.

_Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities_

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $318.0 million, from $368.1 million during
the year ended December 31, 2018 to $50.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The
decrease is mainly attributable to an increase of $316.0 million in bank loan repayments, a decrease of
$208.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners’ issuance of preference units, a decrease of
$60.4 million in proceeds from the GasLog Partners’ common unit offerings, an increase of
$46.7 million in payments for NOK bond repurchase at a premium, an increase of $26.6 million in cash
used for purchases of treasury shares or common units of GasLog Partners, an increase of $18.5 million
in payments of loan issuance costs, an increase of $15.4 million in dividend payments on common and
preference shares, an increase of $3.7 million in payments for cross currency swaps’ termination, an
increase of $2.6 million in payments for lease liabilities, an increase of $0.8 million in payments for
equity-related costs and a decrease of $0.5 million in proceeds from stock option exercise, partially
offset by an increase of $381.6 million in proceeds from borrowings.

**_Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018_**

**2017** **2018** **Change**

**Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars**
Net cash provided by operating activities . . . . . . $ 223,630 $ 283,710 $ 60,080

Net cash provided by financing activities . . . . . . 7,265 368,120 360,855

_Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities_

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $60.1 million, from $223.6 million during the
year ended December 31, 2017 to $283.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The
increase was attributable to an increase in total revenues (revenues and net pool allocation) of
$103.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of $23.5 million caused by movements in working capital
accounts, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for interest including the interest paid for finance
leases and a net decrease of $4.8 million from the remaining movements.

_Net Cash Used In Investing Activities_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $618.4 million, from $74.6 million during the year
ended December 31, 2017 to $693.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is
mainly attributable to an increase of $591.5 million in payments for the construction costs of
newbuildings and other fixed assets and a net decrease in cash from short-term investments of
$43.0 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The above movements were partially offset by $14.0 million in
payments made for the investment in Gastrade made in 2017 and an increase of $2.1 million in cash
from interest income.

_Net Cash Provided By Financing Activities_

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $360.8 million, from $7.3 million during the
year ended December 31, 2017 to $368.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The
increase is mainly attributable to an increase of $244.2 million in proceeds from our borrowings, a
decrease in bank loan and bond repayments of $165.3 million, an increase of $69.2 million in proceeds
from the issuance of the Partnership’s Series B and Series C Preference Units in 2018 as compared to
the issuance of 5,750,000 of its 8.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating
Rate Preference Units (the ‘‘Partnership’s Series A Preference Units’’) in 2017 and an increase of
$20.6 million from payments during 2017 for CCS termination. The above movements were partially
offset by a decrease of $81.1 million in proceeds from GasLog Partners’ common unit offerings and an
increase of $57.0 million in dividend payments.

**_Covenants and Events of Default_**

_General_

Our credit facilities impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions
generally limit our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

-  incur additional indebtedness, create liens or provide guarantees;

-  provide any form of credit or financial assistance to, or enter into any non-arms’ length
transactions with, us or any of our affiliates;

-  sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including our ships;

-  engage in merger transactions;

-  terminate any charter;

-  amend our shipbuilding contracts;

-  change the manager of our ships;

-  undergo a change in ownership; or

-  acquire assets, make investments or enter into any joint venture arrangements outside of the
ordinary course of business.

Our credit facilities (with the exception of the 2019 GasLog Partners Facility) also impose specified
financial covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These financial
covenants include the following:

-  our net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than
$0;

-  our total indebtedness divided by our total assets must not exceed 75.0%;

-  the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments must be at least
$75.0 million;

-  the ratio of EBITDA over our debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments)
on a trailing 12 months’ basis must be not less than 110.0%. The ratio shall be regarded as
having been complied with even if the ratio falls below the stipulated 110% when cash and cash
equivalent and short-term investments are at least $110.0 million; and

-  our market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.

In the case where the Partnership is a guarantor to our Credit Facilities, such facilities also impose
specified financial covenants that apply to the Partnership and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
These financial covenants include the following:

-  the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and available
undrawn facilities with remaining maturities of at least six months (excluding loans from
affiliates) must be at least $45.0 million;

-  total indebtedness divided by total assets must be less than 65.0%; and

-  the Partnership is permitted to declare or pay any dividends or distributions, subject to no event
of default having occurred or occurring as a consequence of the payment of such dividends or
distributions.

89


-----

Our credit facilities also impose certain restrictions relating to us and our other subsidiaries,
including restrictions that limit our ability to make any substantial change in the nature of our business
or to engage in transactions that would constitute a change of control, as defined in the relevant credit
facility, without repaying all of our indebtedness in full, or to allow our largest shareholders to reduce
their shareholding in us below specified thresholds.

Certain of our credit facilities also contain vessel employment conditions, pursuant to which we
could be required in the event of a charter termination or in certain other circumstances to deposit
cash in an account held with the applicable lender until we have obtained a new time charter on terms
acceptable to such lender, or under certain of our credit facilities repay the outstanding loan amount.

Our credit facilities contain customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or
interest, breach of covenants or material inaccuracy of representations, default under other material
indebtedness and bankruptcy. In addition, our credit facilities contain covenants requiring us and
certain of our subsidiaries to maintain the aggregate of (i) the market value, on a charter exclusive
basis, of the mortgaged vessel or vessels and (ii) the market value of any additional security provided to
the lenders, at a total value not less than 120.0% of the then outstanding amount under the applicable
facility (in the case of each individual vessel in the October 2015 Facility and 7xNB Facility, 115.0% for
the first two years after each drawdown and 120.0% at any time thereafter). If we fail to comply with
these covenants and are not able to obtain covenant waivers or modifications, our lenders could require
us to make prepayments or provide additional collateral sufficient to bring us into compliance with
such covenants, and if we fail to do so our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness.

Compliance with the financial covenants is required on a semi-annual basis and we were in
compliance with the respective financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.

_2019 GasLog Partners Facility_

On February 20, 2019, GAS-three Ltd., GAS-four Ltd., GAS-five Ltd., GAS-sixteen Ltd.,
GAS-seventeen Ltd., GasLog Partners and GasLog Partners Holdings LLC entered into a loan
agreement with Credit Suisse AG, Nordea Bank ABP, filial i Norge, and Iyo Bank, Ltd. Singapore
Branch, each an original lender and Nordea acting as security agent and trustee for and on behalf of
the other finance parties mentioned above, for a credit facility for up to $450.0 million (the ‘‘2019
GasLog Partners Facility’’) for the purpose of refinancing in full the existing Partnership Facility.
Subsequently, on the same date, the Development Bank of Japan, Inc. entered the facility as lender via
transfer certificate. The vessels covered by the 2019 GasLog Partners Facility are the GasLog Shanghai,
the GasLog Santiago, the GasLog Sydney, the Methane Rita Andrea and the Methane Jane Elizabeth.

The agreement provides for an amortizing revolving credit facility which can be repaid and
redrawn at any time, subject to the outstanding amount immediately after any drawdown not exceeding
(i) 75% of the aggregate of the market values of all vessels under the agreement, or (ii) the total
facility amount. The total facility amount reduces in 20 equal quarterly amounts of $7.4 million, with a
final balloon amount of $302.9 million reducing concurrently with the last quarterly reduction in
February 2024. The credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin. The facility is currently
undrawn.

The obligations under the 2019 GasLog Partners Facility are secured by a first priority mortgage
over the vessels, a pledge of the share capital of the respective vessel owning companies and a first
priority assignment of earnings related to the vessels, including charter revenue, management revenue
and any insurance and requisition compensation. The obligations under the facility are guaranteed by
the Partnership and GasLog Partners Holdings LLC.

The 2019 GasLog Partners Facility is subject to the Partnership’s financial covenants and to our
customary restrictions and events of default.

_GasLog Warsaw Facility_

On June 25, 2019, GasLog Hellas-1 Special Maritime Enterprise entered into a loan agreement
with ABN AMRO BANK N.V. and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, for the financing of
the GasLog Warsaw, which was delivered on July 31, 2019 (the ‘‘GasLog Warsaw Facility’’). The
agreement provides for a single tranche of $129.5 million that was drawn on July 25, 2019 and is
repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments of $1.6 million each and a final balloon payment of
$84.2 million payable concurrently with the last quarterly installment in June 2026. The loan bears
interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

The obligations under the GasLog Warsaw Facility are secured by a first priority mortgage over the
vessel, a pledge of the share capital of the respective vessel-owning company and a first priority
assignment of earnings related to the vessel. The obligations under the facility are guaranteed by
GasLog and GasLog Carriers.

The GasLog Warsaw Facility is subject to our financial covenants and to our customary restrictions
and events of default.

_7xNB Facility_

On December 12, 2019, GAS-twenty eight Ltd., GAS-thirty Ltd., GAS-thirty one Ltd., GAS-thirty
two Ltd., GAS-thirty three Ltd., GAS-thirty four Ltd. and GAS-thirty five Ltd. entered into a loan
agreement with 13 international banks, with Citibank N.A. London Branch and DNB Bank ASA,
London Branch acting as agents on behalf of the other finance parties. The financing is backed by the
Export Import Bank of Korea (‘‘KEXIM’’) and the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (‘‘K-Sure’’),
who are either directly lending or providing cover for over 60% of the facility. The agreement of up to
$1,052.8 million partially finances the delivery of seven newbuilds scheduled to be delivered in 2020 and
2021. The loan agreement provides for four tranches of $176.5 million $174.8 million, $356.7 million,
and $344.8 million. The facility will be also sub-divided into seven loans, one loan per newbuilding
vessel, to be provided for each of the vessels on a pro rata basis under each of the four tranches. Each
drawing under the first three tranches shall combine to be repaid in 24 consecutive semi-annual equal
installments commencing six months after the actual delivery of the relevant vessel according to an
average 12-year profile. Each drawing under the fourth tranche shall be repaid in a single bullet seven
years after the actual delivery of the relevant vessel. The obligations under the 7xNB Facility are
secured by a first priority mortgage over the vessel, a pledge of the share capital of the respective
vessel-owning company and a first priority assignment of earnings related to the vessel. The obligations
under the facility are guaranteed by GasLog and GasLog Carriers.

The 7xNB Facility is subject to our financial covenants and to our customary restrictions and
events of default.

**Bonds**

On June 27, 2016, GasLog completed the issuance of NOK 750.0 million (equivalent to
$90.2 million) of NOK 2021 Bonds in the Norwegian bond market. The NOK 2021 Bonds were due to
mature in May 2021. On November 27, 2019, GasLog completed the issuance of NOK 900 million
(equivalent to $98.6 million) of NOK 2024 Bonds in the Norwegian bond market. The NOK 2024
Bonds will mature in November 2024 and bear interest at NIBOR plus margin. Interest payments shall
be made in arrears on a quarterly basis. We may redeem the aforementioned bond in whole or in part
as from May 2024 at 101% of par plus accrued interests on the redeemed amount. On November 27,
2019, we repurchased and cancelled NOK 316 million of the outstanding NOK 2021 Bonds at a price
of 104.75% of par value. Subsequently on January 31, 2020, we repurchased and cancelled the
outstanding NOK 2021 Bonds, at a price of 104% of par value.

91


-----

Under the terms of the NOK 2021 Bonds, until their cancellation on January 31, 2020, we were
required to comply with the financial covenants listed below:

-  net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must not be less than $0;

-  total indebtedness divided by total assets must not exceed 75.0%;

-  the ratio of EBITDA over debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments) on a
trailing 12 months’ basis must be not less than 110.0%;

-  the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must not be less than the
higher of 3.0% of total indebtedness and $50.0 million after the first drawdown; and

-  the Group’s market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.

In addition, we were not permitted to make Distributions that in aggregate exceed during any
calendar year, 50% of the Group’s consolidated net profit after taxes based on the audited annual
accounts for the previous financial year (any unutilized portion of the permitted Distributions pursuant
to the above may not be carried forward). For the purposes of the above, the consolidated net profit
after taxes of the Group could not include any profits related to the sale of assets (and consequently
any such profits could not form the basis for Distributions). Under the terms of the NOK 2021 Bonds,
GasLog was permitted to make Distributions up to a maximum amount per share per annum for the
years 2019, 2020 and 2021 of $1.20/share, provided that GasLog demonstrate, by delivering a
compliance certificate to the bond trustee, that no event of default was continuing or would result from
such Distributions.

Under the terms of the NOK 2024 Bonds we are required to comply with the financial covenants
listed below:

-  net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must not be less than $0;

-  total indebtedness divided by total assets must not exceed 75.0%;

-  the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments must be at least
$75.0 million;

-  the ratio of EBITDA over our debt service obligations (including interest and debt repayments)
on a trailing 12 months’ basis must be not less than 110.0%. The ratio shall be regarded as
having been complied with even if the ratio falls below the stipulated 110% when cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments are at least $110.0 million; and

-  the Group’s market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $350.0 million.

In addition, the terms of the NOK 2024 Bonds include a dividend restriction according to which
we may not make Distributions that in aggregate exceed during any calendar year $1.10/share.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, GasLog may make any amount of Distributions, so long as the Group’s
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed $150.0 million, provided that GasLog can
demonstrate, by delivering a compliance certificate to the bond trustee, that no event of default is
continuing or would result from such Distributions.

On March 22, 2017, GasLog closed a public offering of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount
of the 8.875% Senior Notes at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount. The net
proceeds from the offering after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses were
$245.3 million.

On May 16, 2019, GasLog closed a follow-on issue of $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of
the 8.875% Senior Notes priced at 102.5% of par with a yield to maturity of 7.89%. The gross proceeds

92


-----

from this offering were $76.9 million, including a $1.9 million premium, while the net proceeds, after
deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $75.4 million.

Interest payment shall be made in arrears on a quarterly basis. GasLog may redeem the 8.875%
Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to
the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of redemption and (b) determined by the quotation agent, the sum of the present values of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (not including any portion of such
payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption
date on a quarterly basis at the adjusted treasury rate, plus 50 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid
interest thereon to the date of redemption.

GasLog as issuer of the 8.875% Senior Notes is required to comply with financial covenants which
include the following:

-  net working capital (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) must be not less than $0;

-  total indebtedness divided by total indebtedness plus total equity must not exceed 75.0%;

-  the ratio of EBITDA over debt service, on a trailing four quarter basis, shall be not less than
100.0%;

-  the aggregate amount of all unencumbered cash and cash equivalents must be not less than the
higher of 2.50% of total indebtedness or $35.0 million;

-  the issuer’s market value adjusted net worth must at all times be not less than $300.0 million.

Compliance with covenants under the NOK 2021 Bonds was required at all times until their
cancellation, compliance with covenants under the NOK 2024 Bonds and the 8.875% Senior Notes is
required at all times and we were in compliance with the respective financial covenants as of
December 31, 2019.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

For information about our exposure to market risks, see ‘‘Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk’’.

**Capital Expenditures**

We make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with the expansion, operation and
maintenance of our owned fleet. In 2010 we took delivery of two LNG carriers, in 2013 we took
delivery of six LNG carriers and acquired a secondhand vessel, in 2014 we took delivery of two LNG
carriers and acquired six secondhand vessels, in 2015 we acquired two secondhand vessels and took
delivery of one LNG carrier, in 2016 we took delivery of four LNG carriers, in 2018 we took delivery
of three LNG carriers and in 2019 we took delivery of two LNG carriers. During the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we funded $0.5 billion, $0.7 billion, $0.1 billion and
$0.8 billion, respectively, of acquisition, construction and delivery costs, including installment payments
on newbuildings, with funds borrowed under credit facilities and the bonds, capital contributions from
our pre-IPO shareholders, proceeds from our IPO and the GasLog Partners’ IPO, proceeds from
follow-on equity offerings and private placements and proceeds from the sale of vessels to GasLog
Partners.

As of December 31, 2019, our commitments for capital expenditures related primarily to seven
contracted LNG carriers on order were approximately $1,113.0 million. Amounts are payable under
each shipbuilding contract in installments upon the attainment of certain specified milestones in each

93


-----

ship’s construction, with the largest portion of the purchase price for each ship coming due upon its
delivery.

We intend to fund these commitments from borrowings under the 7xNB Facility which has an
undrawn amount of $1,052.8 million, available cash, new bank loan facilities and cash from operations.

To the extent that we are unable to draw down the amounts committed under our credit facilities,
we will need to find alternative financing. If we are unable to find alternative financing, we will not be
capable of funding all of our commitments for capital expenditures relating to our contracted
newbuildings and secondhand vessels, which could adversely impact our ability to pay dividends to our
shareholders and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized
in the consolidated financial statements. GasLog’s management evaluates whether estimates should be
made on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods
management considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. However, uncertainty about these
assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the
carrying amount of the assets or liabilities in the future. Critical accounting policies are those that
reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under
different assumptions and conditions. For a description of our critical accounting judgments and key
sources of estimation uncertainty in applying our accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.

**_Classification of the Non-Controlling Interests_**

The non-controlling interests in the Partnership comprise the portion of the Partnership’s common
units that are not directly or indirectly held by GasLog (32,483,580 units as of December 31, 2019).
Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the Partnership is required to distribute 100.0% of
available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) with respect to each quarter within 45 days of
the end of the quarter to the partners. Available cash can be summarized as cash and cash equivalents
less an amount equal to cash reserves established by the Partnership’s board of directors to (i) provide
for the proper conduct of the business of the Partnership (including reserves for future capital
expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs of the Partnership) subsequent to such quarter,
(ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument
or other agreement or obligation to which any Partnership group member is a party or by which it is
bound or its assets are subject and/or (iii) provide funds for certain distributions relating to future
periods.

In reaching a judgment as to whether the non-controlling interests in the Partnership should be
classified as liabilities or equity interests, management has considered the wide discretion of the
Partnership’s board of directors to determine whether any portion of the amount of cash available to
the Partnership constitutes available cash and that it is possible that there could be no available cash.
In the event that there is no available cash, as determined by the Partnership’s board of directors, the
Partnership does not have a contractual obligation to make a distribution. Accordingly, management
has concluded that the non-controlling interests do not represent a contractual obligation on the
Partnership to deliver cash and therefore should be classified as equity within the financial statements.

**_Impairment of Vessels_**

We evaluate the carrying amounts of our vessels to determine whether there is any indication that
our vessels have suffered an impairment loss by considering both internal and external sources of

information. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of vessels is estimated in order to
determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Our estimates of
recoverable value assume that the vessels are all in seaworthy condition without need for repair and
certified in class without notations of any kind. In assessing the fair value less cost to sell of the vessel,
we obtain charter free market values for each vessel from independent and internationally recognized
ship brokers on a semi-annual basis, which are also commonly used and accepted by our lenders for
determining compliance with the relevant covenants in our credit facilities. Vessel values can be highly
volatile, so the charter-free market values may not be indicative of the current or future market value
of our vessels or prices that could be achieved if we were to sell them. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. The projection of cash flows related to vessels is
complex and requires management to make various estimates including future charter rates, vessel
operating expenses and the discount rate.

The table below sets forth in U.S. dollars (i) the historical acquisition cost of our vessels and
(ii) the carrying value of each of our vessels as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, after
giving effect to the aggregate impairment charge of $162.1 million recorded against our six Steam
vessels.

As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amounts of each of the six Steam vessels (the Methane Rita
_Andrea, the Methane Jane Elizabeth, the_ _Methane Lydon Volney, the Methane Alison Victoria, the_
_Methane Shirley Elisabeth and the_ _Methane Heather Sally), of eight TFDE vessels (the GasLog_
_Savannah, the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Seattle, the Solaris, the GasLog Saratoga, the GasLog_
_Salem, the Methane Julia Louise and the_ _Methane Becki Anne) and three X-DF vessels (the GasLog_
_Genoa, the GasLog Gladstone and the_ _GasLog Hong Kong) were higher than the charter free market_
values estimated by ship brokers. We concluded that this, together with certain other events and
circumstances such as the lack of liquidity in the market for term employment for Steam vessels and
reduced expectations for the estimated rates at which such term employment could be secured, and
together with the continued addition of modern, larger and more fuel efficient LNG carriers to the
global fleet, indicated the existence of potential impairment of these vessels. As a result, we performed
an impairment assessment for these vessels by comparing their values in use, being the discounted
projected net operating cash flows for these vessels to their carrying values. The assumptions that we
used in its discounted projected net operating cash flow analysis included, among others, utilization,
operating revenues, voyage expenses and commissions, dry-docking costs, operating expenses (including
management costs), residual values and the discount rate. The key assumptions, being those to which
the outcome of the impairment assessment is most sensitive, are the estimate of charter rates for
non-contracted revenue days and the discount rate.

Revenue assumptions were based on contracted time charters up to the end of the current contract
for each vessel, as well as the estimated average time charter rates for the remaining life of the vessel
after the completion of its current contract. The revenue assumptions exclude days of scheduled
off-hire based on the fleet’s historical performance and internal forecasts. The estimated daily time
charter rates used for non-contracted revenue days after the completion of the current time charter are
based on a combination of (i) recent charter market rates, (ii) conditions existing in the LNG market
as of December 31, 2019, (iii) historical average time charter rates, based on publications by
independent third party maritime research services (‘‘maritime research publications’’), (iv) estimated
future time charter rates, based on maritime research publications that provide such forecasts and
(v) our internal assessment of long-term charter rates achievable by each class of vessel. See Note 2 to
our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Recognizing that the LNG industry is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors
beyond our control, management believes that the use of the revenue estimates discussed above to be
reasonable as of the reporting date. We have assumed no inflation nor any other revenue escalation or
growth factors in determining forecasted time charter rates beyond the contracted charter period
through the end of a vessel’s useful life, consistent with long-run historical evidence.

We used an annual operating expenses escalation factor equal to 1% based on its historical data
and experience, as well as expectations of future inflation and operating and dry-docking costs.
Estimates for the remaining useful lives of the current fleet and residual and scrap values are the same
as those used for our depreciation policy. All estimates used and assumptions made were in accordance
with our internal budgets and historical experience of the shipping industry.

In our impairment assessment, the rate used to discount future estimated cash flows to their
present values was approximately 6.5% to 7.25% as of December 31, 2019 (7.5% as of December 31,
2018). This was based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital calculated using cost of equity
and cost of debt components, adjusted also for vessel-specific risks and uncertainties.

As a result of its impairment assessment, the Group recognized a non-cash impairment loss of
$162.1 million for its six Steam vessels built in 2006 and 2007 and determined there was no impairment
of the remaining vessels.

In connection with the impairment testing of our vessels as of December 31, 2019, for the 17
vessels with carrying amounts higher than the estimated charter-free market value, we performed a

97


-----

sensitivity analysis on the average re-chartering hire rate used to forecast future cash flows for
non-contracted days which is the most difficult, subjective, or complex assumption that has the potential
to affect the outcome of the impairment exercise. The following table summarizes the average results
of the sensitivity analysis that we performed for the TFDE and X-DF vessels for which no impairment
loss was recognized.

**Average break-**
**Average re-chartering** **even re-chartering** **Variance**
**Propulsion** **hire rate used[(1)]** **hire rate[(2)]** **(Amount)** **Variance (%)**

TFDE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $64,971 $58,385 $ 6,586 11%
X-DF . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $75,000 $47,106 $27,894 59%

(1) The average re-chartering hire rate used in our impairment testing is the average re-chartering rate based on which we
estimated the revenues for the remaining useful life of the respective vessels after the expiry of their contracted periods.

(2) The average break-even re-chartering hire rate is the average of the contracted charter rate that, if used in the discounted
projected net operating cash flows of the impairment testing after the expiry of each vessel’s contracted period, would result
in discounted total cash flows being equal to the carrying value of the vessels.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

**C. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc.**

From time to time we incur expenditures relating to inspections for acquiring new vessels. Such
expenditures are insignificant and are expensed as they are incurred.

**D. Trend Information**

See ‘‘Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Overview—Industry Overview and
Trends’’.

**E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2019, we do not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that should
be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.

**_Board Leadership Structure_**

Our board leadership structure consists of our Chairman, the vice chairman/ senior independent
director and the chairmen of our board committees. Our operational management is headed by our
CEO. Mr. Wogan, as CEO, is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company, which
includes decisions relating to the Company’s general management and control of its affairs and business
and works with our board in developing our business strategy. The board of directors does not have a
policy mandating that the roles of CEO and Chairman be held by separate individuals, but believes that
the separation of such roles at this time is appropriate and beneficial to shareholders.

Dennis M. Houston, who serves as our senior independent director, acts as a liaison to facilitate
communication between independent directors and our Chairman to ensure that the board functions in
an effective manner.

**B. Compensation of Directors and Senior Management**

Our non-executive directors receive:

-  an annual fee of $132,000;

-  an additional annual fee of $20,000 to the senior independent director;

-  additional annual fees of $100,000 to the chairman of the board, $30,000 to the vice-chairman of
the board $50,000 to the chairman of the audit and risk committee and $20,000 to the chairmen
of the compensation committee and Safety and Sustainability committee; and

-  additional annual fees of $25,000 to each member of the audit and risk committee and $20,000
to each member of the compensation committee and Safety and Sustainability committee (in
each case other than the chairmen of such committees); and

The aggregate annual fees paid to non-executive directors in 2019 was $1.7 million.

The board of directors may determine that a portion of the above fees will be paid in shares
rather than cash.

In addition, our directors receive reimbursement for their out-of-pocket expenses including travel
costs. We do not have any service contracts with our directors that provide for benefits upon
termination of their services.

For 2019, our executive officers were Paul Wogan, Alastair Maxwell, Richard Sadler (COO to
September 17, 2019) and Paolo Enoizi (COO from September 17, 2019 onwards). Compensation for
our executive officers in 2019 consisted of base salary and employee benefits that are generally
provided to employees, including eligibility to receive a cash incentive bonus pursuant to our
Management Incentive Plan, or ‘‘MIP’’. The MIP provides all shore-based personnel (which includes
our executive officers) an opportunity to earn a cash incentive payment based on a target percentage of
the participant’s annual base salary, subject to the achievement of pre-established individual and
Company performance objectives, as well as a component based on Company discretion. Each
participant’s target percentage of annual base salary and the weightings assigned to the individual and
Company performance objectives and the Company discretionary component are dependent on the
participant’s organization (band) level. No amounts will be paid under the MIP to any participant who
fails to achieve 50.0% of his or her target individual performance objectives. In 2019, the Company
performance objectives were measured against three equally-weighted key business indicators (‘‘KBI’’):

103


-----

The Financial KBI is measured against a Free Cash Flow per Share target and an Absolute Return on
Invested Capital target; the Operational KBI is defined by a basket of operational KBIs including Fleet
Uptime, Vetting Performance and Terminal Feedback targets; and three-year rolling average Relative
Total Shareholder Return performance compared to a peer group. In addition, Company performance
is evaluated against a safety factor based on Personal Safety, Significant Incidents and Leading
Indicators, in which falling short of the safety target may result in a corresponding reduction of the
Company performance payout factor. Under the individual and Company performance objectives,
stretch goals are established which determine the level of pay-out. The Board may exercise discretion
to increase an individual’s payment to no more than 200.0% of his or her target payout. The amounts
paid to our executive officers in 2019 pursuant to the MIP were determined based on the following
weightings: individual performance (30.0%), Company performance (50.0%) and Company discretion
(20.0%).

The aggregate amount of cash compensation, including cash incentive compensation, paid to our
executive officers for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.16 million.

In addition, our executive officers received equity-based compensation awards in accordance with
the 2013 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, or the ‘‘Plan’’, and also received awards via the
GasLog Partners LP 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan or the ‘‘the GasLog Partners LTIP Plan’’. On
April 1, 2019, we granted our executive officers an aggregate of 109,131 stock options and 35,949
restricted stock units under the Plan. Additionally, on August 20, 2019 we granted an extra aggregate of
27,132 stock options and 7,410 shares of restricted stock. Furthermore, on April 1, 2019, we granted
our executive officers an aggregate of 6,164 restricted stock units and 6,164 phantom performance
common units under the GasLog Partners Plan. The aggregate fair value for all equity compensation
granted in 2019 is $1.75 million. At the time of grant, the stock options had an exercise price per share
of $17.79 ($12.34 for the August grant) which was subsequently adjusted to $17.41 ($11.96 for the
August grant) on December 16, 2019 in response to the announcement of an extraordinary dividend of
$0.38 and will vest in three equal annual installments, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant
date, subject to the recipient’s continued service. The restricted stock units vest on the third anniversary
of the grant date, subject to the recipient’s continued service. Vesting of the phantom performance
common units is also subject to the achievement of certain performance targets. The stock options, the
restricted stock units and the phantom performance common units may be settled in cash or common
shares, or a combination thereof, at our discretion. We generally determine during the March meeting
of the board of the directors each year which individuals, if any, will be eligible to receive equity-based
compensation awards under the Plan for such year and the amount of awards each participant will be
eligible to receive. In addition, we intend to grant such awards on April 1 of such year (or, should
April 1 of such year fall on a weekend or bank holiday, on the first business day thereafter).

We did not set aside or accrue any amounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 to provide
pension, retirement or similar benefits to our directors or executive officers.

**C. Board Practices**

Our board of directors consists of nine members. The board of directors may change the number
of directors to not less than three, nor more than fifteen. Each director shall be elected to serve until
the next annual meeting of shareholders or until his successor is elected or appointed, except in the
event of removal, death, disability, disqualification or resignation. A vacancy on the board created by
removal, death, disability, disqualification or resignation of a director, or as a result of an increase in
the size of the board, may be filled by the shareholders or by the board of directors.

We are a ‘‘foreign private issuer’’ under the securities laws of the United States and the rules of
the NYSE. Under the securities laws of the United States, ‘‘foreign private issuers’’ are subject to
different disclosure requirements than U.S. domiciled registrants, as well as different financial reporting

104


-----

requirements. Under the NYSE rules, a ‘‘foreign private issuer’’ is subject to less stringent corporate
governance requirements. Subject to certain exceptions, the rules of the NYSE permit a ‘‘foreign
private issuer’’ to follow its home country practice in lieu of the listing requirements of the NYSE,
including (i) the requirement that a nominating/corporate governance committee be established and
(ii) the requirement of an annual performance evaluation of the compensation committee. We do not
have a separate nominating/corporate governance committee and we complete biennial performance
evaluation of the compensation committee. As a result, non-independent directors may, among other
things, participate in resolving governance issues regarding our Company. Accordingly, in the future
you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of
the NYSE corporate governance requirements.

Our board of directors meets regularly throughout the year. In 2019, the board met 11 times. As
part of our board meetings, our independent directors meet without the non-independent directors in
attendance. In addition, the board regularly holds sessions without the CEO and executive officers
present.

**Committees of the Board of Directors**

**_Audit and Risk Committee_**

Our audit and risk committee consists of Messrs. Conner, Houston and Kintzer with Mr. Kintzer

these individuals meets the definition of ‘‘independent director’’ for purposes of serving on an audit
committee under applicable SEC and NYSE rules. Mr. Conner and Mr. Kintzer each qualifies as an

-  performing such other functions as the board may direct or request from time to time.

**Corporate Governance**

The board of directors and our Company’s management engage in an ongoing review of our
corporate governance practices in order to oversee our compliance with the applicable corporate
governance rules of the NYSE and the SEC.

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all directors, officers, employees and
agents of the Company.

This document and other important information on our governance are posted on our website and
may be viewed at http://www.gaslogltd.com. The information contained on or connected to our website is
not a part of this annual report. We will also provide a paper copy of any of these documents upon the
written request of a shareholder at no cost. Shareholders may direct their requests to the attention of
our General Counsel, c/o GasLog LNG Services Ltd., 69 Akti Miaouli, 18537 Piraeus, Greece.

**Exemptions from NYSE Corporate Governance Rules**

Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under SEC rules, we are permitted to follow the
corporate governance practices of Bermuda (the jurisdiction in which we are incorporated) in lieu of
certain NYSE corporate governance requirements that would otherwise be applicable to us. The NYSE
rules do not require foreign private issuers like us to establish a nominating/corporate governance
committee. Similarly, under Bermuda law, we are not required to have a nominating/corporate
governance committee. Accordingly, we do not have a nominating/corporate governance committee.

**D. Employees**

As of December 31, 2019, we had 163 full-time employees and contractors based in our offices in
Greece, Monaco, London, Stamford Connecticut, Singapore and the newbuildings site in South Korea.
In addition to our shore-based employees and contractors, we had approximately 1,654 seafaring staff
serving on our owned and managed ships. These seafarers are retained through crewing agencies based
in Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain or, in the case of Greek seafarers, through direct hire. As we
take delivery of our newbuildings, we expect to recruit a significant number of additional seafarers
qualified to staff and operate our new ships, as well as a small number of additional shore-based
personnel. We intend to focus our seafarer hiring efforts in the Ukraine, the Philippines and Spain,
where we have crewing agency agreements in place, and in Greece.

LNG marine transportation is a specialized area requiring technically skilled officers and personnel
with specialized training. Attracting and retaining motivated, well-qualified seagoing and shore-based
personnel is a top priority, and we offer our people competitive compensation packages and training
and development opportunities. In addition, we provide intensive onboard training for our officers and

107


-----

crews to instill a culture focused on the highest operational and safety standards. As a result, we have
historically enjoyed high retention rates. In 2019, our retention rate was 97% for senior seagoing
officers, 93% for other seagoing officers and 94% for shore staff.

Although we have historically experienced high employee retention rates, the demand for
technically skilled officers and crews to serve on LNG carriers and FSRU vessels, and for shore-based
employees with experience of operating and managing LNG vessels, has been increasing as the global
fleet of LNG vessels continues to grow. This increased demand has and may continue to put
inflationary cost pressure on ensuring qualified and well-trained crew are available to GasLog.
However, we expect that the impact of cost increases would be mitigated to some extent by certain
provisions in some of our time charters, including automatic periodic adjustment and cost review
provisions.

**E. Share Ownership**

The common shares beneficially owned by our directors and executive officers and/or entities
affiliated with these individuals is disclosed in ‘‘Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party
Transactions—A. Major Shareholders’’ below. For information regarding arrangements for involving the
employees in the capital of the Company, see ‘‘Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and
Employees—B. Compensation of Directors and Senior Management’’.

Mr. Livanos and (d) by several entities of which Mr. Livanos and/or members of his family are beneficiaries and
for which Mr. Livanos serves as an officer and/or a board member. Mr. Livanos disclaims beneficial ownership
of the shares held by the entities referenced in (d). Mr. Livanos can effectively control the Company through
direct and indirect ownership interests. Mr. Livanos’s ownership interest changed in connection with the
purchase by Blenheim Holdings of certain outstanding manager shares in January 2012, a transfer by Blenheim
Holdings of 657,090 shares to one of its minority shareholders in March 2014 in exchange for such shareholder’s
interest in Blenheim Holdings, and the vesting of 30,527 Restricted Stock Units in April 2017.

(2) By virtue of common shares held indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiary, Olympic LNG Investments Ltd.
A portion of the shares were acquired from the Company in a private placement in January 2014. The
Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation is the sole beneficiary of the assets and income of the Onassis
Foundation, and as a result may be deemed to have indirect beneficial ownership of the shares.

-  Less than 1.0%.

In March 2012, we completed a registered public offering of our common shares and our common
shares began trading on the NYSE. Our major shareholders have the same voting rights as our other
shareholders. As of February 24, 2020, we had approximately 10,621 shareholders.

**B. Related Party Transactions**

**Relationship with GasLog Partners**

GasLog Partners was formed by us in January 2014 to acquire, own and operate LNG carriers
engaged in LNG transportation under long-term charters, which we define as charters of five full years
or more. In May 2014, the Partnership completed its initial public offering and its common units began
trading on the NYSE. The Partnership conducts its operations through its vessel-owning subsidiaries
and as of March 2, 2020, had a fleet of 15 LNG carriers. As of March 2, 2020, we hold a 35.6%
ownership interest in the Partnership and, as a result of our ownership of the general partner and the
fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership’s directors in accordance with the
Partnership Agreement, we have the ability to control the Partnership’s affairs and policies.

109


-----

**_Quarterly Cash Dividends_**

We are entitled to distributions on our general and limited partner interests in GasLog Partners.
These interests consist of common units and general partner interests. GasLog Partners will distribute
any available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders and the general
partner in the following manner, 98.0% to all common unitholders, pro rata, and 2.0% to the general
partner.

The percentage interests set forth above assume that the general partner maintains its 2.0%
general partner interest and that the Partnership does not issue additional classes of equity securities.

As holder of the 2.0% general partner interest in GasLog Partners, we are entitled to 2.0% of all
distributions made by GasLog Partners prior to its liquidation. The general partner, our wholly owned
subsidiary, has the right, but not the obligation, to contribute a proportionate amount of capital to
GasLog Partners to maintain its 2.0% general partner interest if the Partnership issues additional units.

We received total distributions from GasLog Partners of $33.8 million in 2019.

**_Omnibus Agreement_**

On May 12, 2014, we entered into an omnibus agreement with GasLog Partners and certain of its
subsidiaries. The following discussion describes certain provisions of the omnibus agreement.

_Noncompetition; Five-Year Vessel Restricted Business Opportunities_

Under the omnibus agreement, we have agreed, and have caused our controlled affiliates (other
than GasLog Partners, its general partner and its subsidiaries) to agree, not to acquire, own, operate or
charter any LNG carrier with a cargo capacity greater than 75,000 cbm engaged in oceangoing LNG
transportation under a charter for five full years or more without, within 30 calendar days after the
consummation of the acquisition or the commencement of the operations or charter of such a vessel,
notifying and offering GasLog Partners the opportunity to purchase such a vessel at fair market value.
For purposes of this section, we refer to these vessels, together with any related charters, as ‘‘Five-Year
Vessels’’ and to all other LNG carriers, together with any related charters, as ‘‘Non-Five-Year Vessels’’.
The restrictions in this paragraph will not prevent us or any of our controlled affiliates (other than
GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries) from:

(1) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering Non-Five-Year Vessels;

(2) acquiring one or more Five-Year Vessels if we promptly offer to sell the vessel to GasLog
Partners for the acquisition price plus any administrative costs (including re-flagging and
reasonable legal costs) associated with the transfer to GasLog Partners at the time of the
acquisition;

(3) putting a Non-Five-Year Vessel under charter for five full years or more if we offer to sell the
vessel to GasLog Partners for fair market value (x) promptly after the time it becomes a
Five-Year Vessel and (y) at each renewal or extension of that charter for five full years or
more;

(4) acquiring one or more Five-Year Vessels as part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in
a business or package of assets and owning, operating or chartering those vessels; provided,
however, that:

(a) if less than a majority of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to
Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, we must offer to
sell such vessels to GasLog Partners for their fair market value plus any additional tax or

110


-----

other similar costs that we incur in connection with the acquisition and the transfer of
such vessels to GasLog Partners separate from the acquired business; and

(b) if a majority or more of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to
Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, we must notify
GasLog Partners of the proposed acquisition in advance. Not later than 30 days following
receipt of such notice, GasLog Partners will notify us if it wishes to acquire such vessels
in cooperation and simultaneously with us acquiring the Non-Five-Year Vessels. If
GasLog Partners does not notify us of its intent to pursue the acquisition within 30 days,
we may proceed with the acquisition and then offer to sell such vessels to GasLog
Partners as provided in (a) above;

(5) acquiring a non-controlling equity ownership, voting or profit participation interest in any
company, business or pool of assets;

(6) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering any Five-Year Vessel if GasLog Partners does not
fulfill its obligation to purchase such vessel in accordance with the terms of any existing or
future agreement;

(7) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering a Five-Year Vessel subject to the offers to GasLog
Partners described in paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) above pending its determination whether to
accept such offers and pending the closing of any offers it accepts;

(8) providing ship management services relating to any vessel;

(9) owning or operating any Five-Year Vessel that we owned on the closing date of GasLog
Partners’ IPO and that was not part of its fleet as of such date; or

(10) acquiring, owning, operating or chartering a Five-Year Vessel if GasLog Partners has
previously advised us that it consents to such acquisition, ownership, operation or charter.

If we or any of our controlled affiliates (other than GasLog Partners, its general partner or its
subsidiaries) acquires, owns, operates or charters Five-Year Vessels pursuant to any of the exceptions
described above, we may not subsequently expand that portion of our business other than pursuant to
those exceptions. However, such Five-Year Vessels could eventually compete with GasLog Partners’
vessels upon their re-chartering.

In addition, under the omnibus agreement GasLog Partners has agreed, and has caused its
subsidiaries to agree, to acquire, own, operate or charter Five-Year Vessels only. The restrictions in this
paragraph will not:

(1) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from owning, operating or chartering any
Non-Five-Year Vessel that was previously a Five-Year Vessel while owned by GasLog Partners
or any of its subsidiaries;

(2) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from acquiring Non-Five-Year Vessels as
part of the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business or package of assets and owning,
operating or chartering those vessels; provided, however, that:

(a) if less than a majority of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to
Non-Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by GasLog Partners, the Partnership
must offer to sell such vessels to us for their fair market value plus any additional tax or
other similar costs that GasLog Partners incurs in connection with the acquisition and the
transfer of such vessels to us separate from the acquired business; and

(b) if a majority or more of the value of the business or assets acquired is attributable to
Non-Five-Year Vessels, as determined in good faith by GasLog Partners, the Partnership

111


-----

must notify us of the proposed acquisition in advance. Not later than 30 days following
receipt of such notice, we must notify GasLog Partners if we wish to acquire the
Non-Five-Year Vessels in cooperation and simultaneously with GasLog Partners acquiring
the Five-Year Vessels. If we do not notify GasLog Partners of our intent to pursue the
acquisition within 30 days, the Partnership may proceed with the acquisition and then
offer to sell such vessels to us as provided in (a) above;

(3) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from acquiring, owning, operating or
chartering any Non-Five-Year Vessels subject to the offer to us described in paragraph (2)
above, pending our determination whether to accept such offer and pending the closing of any
offer we accept; or

(4) prevent GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries from acquiring, owning, operating or
chartering Non-Five-Year Vessels if we have previously advised the Partnership that we
consent to such acquisition, ownership, operation or charter.

If GasLog Partners or any of its subsidiaries acquires, owns, operates or charters Non-Five-Year
Vessels pursuant to any of the exceptions described above, neither the Partnership nor any subsidiary
may subsequently expand that portion of its business other than pursuant to those exceptions.

During the 30-day period after our notice and offer of an opportunity to purchase a Five-Year
Vessel, we and GasLog Partners will negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the fair market
value (and any applicable break-up costs) of the relevant vessel. If we do not reach an agreement
within such 30-day period, a mutually-agreed upon investment banking firm, ship broker or other expert
advisor will be engaged to determine the fair market value (and any applicable break-up costs) of the
relevant vessel and other outstanding terms, and GasLog Partners will have the option, but not the
obligation, to purchase the relevant vessel on such terms. GasLog Partners’ ability to consummate the
acquisition of such Five-Year Vessel from us will be subject to obtaining any consents of governmental
authorities and other non-affiliated third parties and to all agreements existing with respect to such
Five-Year Vessel. Under the omnibus agreement, we will indemnify GasLog Partners against losses
arising from the failure to obtain any consent or governmental permit necessary to own or operate the
fleet in substantially the same manner that the vessels were owned and operated by us immediately
prior to the Partnership’s acquisition of such vessels. See ‘‘—Indemnification’’.

Upon a change of control of GasLog Partners or its general partner, the noncompetition
provisions of the omnibus agreement will terminate immediately. Upon a change of control of GasLog,
the noncompetition provisions of the omnibus agreement applicable to us will terminate on the date of
the change of control. On the date on which a majority of GasLog Partners’ directors ceases to consist
of directors that were (1) appointed by the Partnership’s general partner prior to its first annual
meeting of unitholders and (2) recommended for election by a majority of the Partnership’s appointed
directors, the noncompetition provisions applicable to us shall terminate immediately.

_LNG Carrier Purchase Options_

Under the omnibus agreement entered into with GasLog Partners and certain of its subsidiaries in
connection with the Partnership’s initial public offering, GasLog Partners has the option to purchase
from us any LNG carrier with a cargo capacity greater than 75,000 cbm engaged in oceangoing LNG
transportation under a charter for five full years or more, within 30 calendar days after the
consummation of the acquisition or the commencement of the operations or charter of such a vessel.

On January 12, 2018, GasLog entered into a shipbuilding contract with Samsung for Hull No. 2213
that is scheduled to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020. This vessel will now be the vessel to be
chartered to Pioneer Shipping Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica for an initial period of
approximately seven years, as previously announced on October 20, 2016. Within 30 days of the

112


-----

commencement of the charter of Hull No. 2213, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners the
opportunity to purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus
agreement.

On May 30, 2018, we signed an agreement with Centrica for newbuilding Hull No. 2262 to be
chartered to Centrica upon delivery in 2020 for an initial term of seven years. Within 30 days of the
commencement of the charter of Hull No. 2262, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners the
opportunity to purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus
agreement. On August 16, 2018, we signed an agreement with Cheniere for newbuildings Hull
Nos. 2300 and 2301 to be chartered to Cheniere upon delivery in 2020 for initial terms of seven years.
Furthermore, on December 21, 2018, we signed two additional agreements with Cheniere for
newbuildings Hull Nos. 2311 and 2312 to be chartered to Cheniere upon delivery in 2021 for initial
terms of seven years. Within 30 days of the commencement of each of the charters, we will be required
to offer GasLog Partners the opportunity to purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined
pursuant to the omnibus agreement.

On March 15, 2019, we signed an agreement with Endesa for the GasLog Warsaw to be chartered
to Endesa from May 2021 for an initial term of eight years. Within 30 days of the commencement of
the charter of the GasLog Warsaw, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners the opportunity to
purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus agreement.

On March 28, 2019, we signed an agreement with JERA for newbuilding Hull No. 2274 to be
chartered to JERA upon delivery in 2020 for an initial term of twelve years. Within 30 days of the
commencement of the charter of Hull No. 2274, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners the
opportunity to purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus
agreement.

On August 27, 2019, we signed an agreement with Sinolam for the GasLog Singapore to be
chartered to Sinolam from November 2020 for an initial term of ten years. Within 30 days of the
commencement of the charter of the _GasLog Singapore, we will be required to offer GasLog Partners_
the opportunity to purchase the vessel at fair market value as determined pursuant to the omnibus
agreement.

In each case, GasLog Partners’ option to purchase is at fair market value as determined pursuant
to the omnibus agreement. If we and GasLog Partners are unable to agree upon the fair market value
of any of these optional vessels, the respective fair market values will be determined by a mutually
acceptable investment banking firm, ship broker or other expert advisor, and GasLog Partners will have
the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the vessel at such price. GasLog Partners’ ability to
consummate the acquisition of such vessels from us will be subject to obtaining any consents of
governmental authorities and other non-affiliated third parties and to all agreements existing as of the
closing date in respect of such vessels.

On the date on which a majority of GasLog Partners’ directors ceases to consist of directors that
were (1) appointed by the Partnership’s general partner prior to its first annual meeting of unitholders
and (2) recommended for election by a majority of the Partnership’s appointed directors, the LNG
carrier purchase options shall terminate immediately.

_Rights of First Offer_

Under the omnibus agreement, we and our subsidiaries have granted to GasLog Partners a right of
first offer on any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of any Five-Year Vessels or Non-Five-Year
Vessels owned by us. Under the omnibus agreement, GasLog Partners and its subsidiaries have agreed
to grant a similar right of first offer to us for any Five-Year Vessels they might own. These rights of
first offer will not apply to a (i) sale, transfer or other disposition of vessels between any affiliated

113


-----

subsidiaries or pursuant to the terms of any current or future charter or other agreement with a charter
party or (ii) merger with or into, or sale of substantially all of the assets to, an unaffiliated third party.

Prior to engaging in any negotiation regarding any vessel disposition with respect to a Five-Year
Vessel with an unaffiliated third party or any Non-Five-Year Vessel, we or GasLog Partners, as the case
may be, will deliver a written notice to the other relevant party setting forth the material terms and
conditions of the proposed transaction. During the 30-day period after the delivery of such notice, we
and GasLog Partners, as the case may be, will negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on the
transaction. If we do not reach an agreement within such 30-day period, we or GasLog Partners, as the
case may be, will be able within the next 180 calendar days to sell, transfer, dispose or re-charter the
vessel to a third party (or to agree in writing to undertake such transaction with a third party) on terms
generally no less favorable to us or GasLog Partners, as the case may be, than those offered pursuant
to the written notice. Our ability to consummate the acquisition of such Five-Year Vessel from GasLog
Partners will be subject to obtaining any consents of governmental authorities and other non-affiliated
third parties and to all agreements existing in respect of such Five-Year Vessel.

Upon a change of control of GasLog Partners or its general partner, the right of first offer
provisions of the omnibus agreement will terminate immediately. Upon a change of control of us, the
right of first offer provisions applicable to GasLog under the omnibus agreement will terminate on the
date of the change of control. On the date on which a majority of GasLog Partners’ directors ceases to
consist of directors that were (i) appointed by the Partnership’s general partner prior to its first annual
meeting of unitholders and (ii) recommended for election by a majority of the Partnership’s appointed
directors, the provisions related to the rights of first offer granted to the Partnership by us shall
terminate immediately.

For purposes of the omnibus agreement, a ‘‘change of control’’ means, with respect to any
‘‘applicable person’’, any of the following events: (a) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one
transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the applicable person’s assets
to any other person, unless immediately following such sale, lease, exchange or other transfer such
assets are owned, directly or indirectly, by the applicable person; (b) the consolidation or merger of the
applicable person with or into another person pursuant to a transaction in which the outstanding voting
securities of the applicable person are changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or other property,
other than any such transaction where (i) the outstanding voting securities of the applicable person are
changed into or exchanged for voting securities of the surviving person or its parent and (ii) the holders
of the voting securities of the applicable person immediately prior to such transaction own, directly or
indirectly, not less than a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving person or its
parent immediately after such transaction; and (c) a ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ (within the meaning of
Sections 13(d) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the ‘‘Exchange Act’’), other than
us or our affiliates with respect to the general partner, being or becoming the ‘‘beneficial owner’’ (as
defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) of more than 50.0% of all of the then
outstanding voting securities of the applicable person, except in a merger or consolidation which would
not constitute a change of control under clause (b) above.

_Indemnification_

Under the omnibus agreement, we will indemnify GasLog Partners after the closing of its IPO for
a period of five years (and we will indemnify the Partnership for a period of at least three years after
its purchase of any vessels subject to purchase options, if applicable) against certain environmental and
toxic tort liabilities with respect to the vessels that are contributed or sold to the Partnership to the
extent arising prior to the time such vessels were contributed or sold to the Partnership. Liabilities
resulting from a change in law after the closing of the IPO are excluded from the environmental
indemnity. There is an aggregate cap of $5 million on the amount of indemnity coverage provided by
us for environmental and toxic tort liabilities. No claim may be made unless the aggregate dollar

114


-----

amount of all claims exceeds $500,000, in which case we are liable for claims only to the extent such
aggregate amount exceeds $500,000.

We will also indemnify GasLog Partners for liabilities related to:

-  certain defects in title to GasLog Partners’ initial fleet and any failure to obtain, prior to the
time they were contributed to the Partnership, certain consents and permits necessary to conduct
the Partnership’s business, which liabilities arise within three years after the closing of the
Partnership’s IPO; and

-  certain tax liabilities attributable to the operation of the assets contributed or sold to the
Partnership prior to the time they were contributed or sold.

**Restrictive Covenant Agreement**

On April 4, 2012, Peter G. Livanos and Blenheim Holdings entered into a Restrictive Covenant
Agreement with us, pursuant to which Mr. Livanos is prohibited from directly or indirectly owning,
operating or managing LNG vessels, other than pursuant to his involvement with us. The restrictions
will terminate in the event that Mr. Livanos ceases to beneficially own at least 20.0% of our issued and
outstanding share capital.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, Mr. Livanos is permitted to engage in the following activities:

-  passive ownership (a) of minority interests in any business that is not primarily engaged in
owning, operating or managing LNG vessels or (b) constituting less than 5.0% of any publicly
listed company; and

-  non-passive participation in a business that acquires an interest in the ownership, operation or
management of LNG vessels, provided that as promptly as reasonably practicable either (A) the
business enters into an agreement to dispose of such competitive activity and such disposition is
completed within a reasonable time, or (B) Mr. Livanos’s participation in such business is
changed so as to satisfy the exception for passive ownership of minority interests in a business
that is not primarily engaged in a competitive activity.

The restrictions described above do not apply to transactions by independent fund managers not
acting under the direction or control of Mr. Livanos or Blenheim Holdings.

As noted above, Mr. Livanos and Blenheim Holdings are permitted under the terms of the
restrictive covenant agreement to dispose of our common shares in the following circumstances:

-  pursuant to any transfer by Blenheim Holdings to its shareholders (including any division of the
ownership interests in Blenheim Holdings of Mr. Livanos), provided that the transferee or
transferees agree to be bound by the share transfer restrictions of the restrictive covenant
agreement;

-  pursuant to any private sale to a strategic investor in the Company, provided that the strategic
investor agrees to be bound by the share transfer restrictions of the restrictive covenant
agreement;

-  in connection with any sale or transfer that would result in a change in control of the Company,
provided that such change in control has been approved by our board of directors; and

-  in transactions relating to shares acquired following the effective date of the restrictive covenant
agreement.

For purposes of the restrictive covenant agreement, a ‘‘change of control’’ means Mr. Livanos and
Blenheim Holdings cease to beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 38.0% of the issued and
outstanding share capital of the Company. The share transfer restrictions described above will

115


-----

terminate as to any person that ceases to beneficially own, or does not beneficially own, at least 20.0%
of our issued and outstanding share capital.

**Registration Rights Agreement**

On April 4, 2012, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain of our shareholders,
pursuant to which we granted such shareholders and their transferees the right, under certain
circumstances and subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions included in the lock-up
agreements to which they will be a party, to require us to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, our common shares held by those persons. Under the registration rights agreement, certain
of our shareholders and their transferees have the right to request us to register the sale of shares held
by them on their behalf and may require us to make available shelf registration statements permitting
sales of shares into the market from time to time over an extended period. While these demand
registration rights are subject to certain timing and other restrictions, there is no limit on the number
of times a shareholder may exercise such rights. In addition, those persons have the ability to exercise
certain piggyback registration rights in connection with registered offerings initiated by us. In March
2014, in response to a Demand Registration Request (as defined in the Registration Rights
Agreement), the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form F-3 registering the common shares
entitled to registration rights in addition to other common shares held by the Company’s directors and
officers.

**Subscription Agreements**

On January 16, 2014, we entered into subscription agreements with certain of our directors and
officers for a concurrent private placement of 2,317,460 common shares at a price of $15.75 per share.

**Indemnification Agreements**

We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers which provide,
among other things, that we will indemnify our directors and officers, under the circumstances and to
the extent provided for therein, for expenses, damages, judgments, fines, settlements and fees that they
may be required to pay in actions or proceedings to which they are or may be made a party by reason
of such person’s position as a director, officer, employee or other agent of the Company, subject to,
and to the maximum extent permitted by, applicable law.

**Office Space and Related Arrangements**

Through our subsidiary GasLog LNG Services, we lease our office space in Piraeus, Greece from
an entity controlled by Ceres Shipping, Nea Dimitra Ktimatikh Kai Emporikh S.A. The lease
agreement is filed with the Greek authorities, and has been entered into on market rates.

GasLog LNG Services has also entered into an agreement with Seres S.A., an entity controlled by
the Livanos family, for the latter to provide catering services to the staff based in our Piraeus office.
Amounts paid pursuant to the agreement are generally less than A10 per person per day, but are
slightly higher on special occasions. In addition, GasLog LNG Services has entered into an agreement
with Seres S.A. for the latter to provide telephone and documentation services for our staff based in
Piraeus. Amounts paid pursuant to the agreement are less than A100,000 per year.

**Egypt LNG**

We have a 25.0% ownership interest in Egypt LNG, whose principal asset is the LNG carrier
_Methane Nile Eagle, which is currently operating under a 20-year time charter with a subsidiary of Shell._
Through our subsidiary GasLog LNG Services, we supervised the construction of the Methane Nile
_Eagle which was delivered from the shipyard in 2007. Pursuant to a ship management agreement_

116


-----

between GasLog LNG Services and Egypt LNG, the vessel has operated under our technical
management since its delivery. From January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019, we received a total of
approximately $0.7 million in revenues from Egypt LNG in respect of our vessel management services.

**Consulting Services Agreements**

GasLog entered into a consulting agreement with Unisea Maritime Ltd. (‘‘Unisea’’), an entity
controlled by the Livanos family, in consideration of the consulting services performed by Unisea in
respect of the sale and leaseback transaction for the Methane Julia Louise. Under the terms of the
consulting agreement, GasLog agreed to pay a brokerage commission fee equal to 0.25% of the agreed
charter rates under the sale and leaseback transaction plus reasonable expenses (in line with the
Company’s policies). The brokerage commission fee was paid in advance for the full 20-year period of
the bareboat charter, discounted to the date of the agreement at an annual discount rate of 7.5%.

GasLog entered into a consulting agreement for the services of an employee of Ceres
Monaco S.A.M., an entity controlled by the Livanos family, for consultancy services in connection with
the acquisition of GasLog’s shareholding in Gastrade and the ongoing work on the development of the
Alexandroupolis FSRU project. GasLog agreed to pay a fixed fee for work carried out between May 1,
2016 and December 31, 2017 in the sum of $100,000 and an ongoing consultancy arrangement fee of
$12,000 per month for a minimum of 12 days per month, terminable upon notice by GasLog.

**Exchange Agreement**

On November 27, 2018, we entered into an agreement with GasLog Partners to modify the
partnership agreement with respect to the general partner’s incentive distribution rights (‘‘IDR’’). The
modification reduced the distributions of cash upon liquidation and the general partner’s IDRs on
quarterly distributions above $0.5625 per unit from 48% to 23%. We further agreed to waive IDR
payments resulting from any asset or business acquired by GasLog Partners from a third party. In
exchange for these modifications, we entered into an agreement among GasLog Partners and GasLog
Partners GP LLC under which we received $25.0 million from GasLog Partners.

**Amendment of the Partnership Agreement**

On June 24, 2019, we entered into an agreement with GasLog Partners to amend the Partnership
Agreement to eliminate the IDRs in exchange for the issuance by the Partnership to GasLog of
2,532,911 common units and 2,490,000 Class B units (of which 415,000 are Class B-1 units, 415,000 are
Class B-2 units, 415,000 are Class B-3 units, 415,000 are Class B-4 units, 415,000 are Class B-5 units
and 415,000 are Class B-6 units), issued on June 30, 2019. Class B units have all of the rights and
obligations attached to the common units, except for voting rights and participation in distributions
until such time as GasLog exercises its right to convert the Class B units to common units. The Class B
units will become eligible for conversion on a one-for-one basis into common units at GasLog’s option
on July 1, 2020, July 1, 2021, July 1, 2022, July 1, 2023, July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025 for the Class B-1
units, Class B-2 units, Class B-3 units, Class B-4 units, Class B-5 units and the Class B-6 units,
respectively. Following the IDR elimination, the allocation of GasLog’s profit to non-controlling
interests is based on the revised distribution policy for available cash stated in the Partnership
Agreement as amended, effective June 30, 2019, and under which 98.0% of the available cash is
distributed to the common unitholders and 2.0% is distributed to the general partner.

**Other Related Party Transactions**

For a description of additional related party transactions, see Note 21 to our consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this annual report.

**Procedures for Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions**

Related party transactions, which means transactions in which the Company or one of its
subsidiaries is a participant and any of the Company’s directors, executive officers or significant
shareholders, or any members of their immediate families or entities controlled by them, have a direct
or indirect interest, will be subject to review and approval or ratification by our audit and risk
committee in accordance with the Related Party Transaction Policy adopted by such committee.

**C. Interests of Experts and Counsel**

Not applicable.

**ITEM 8.** **FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**A. Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information**

See ‘‘Item 18. Financial Statements’’ below.

**Legal Proceedings**

We have not been involved in any legal proceedings that we believe may have a significant effect
on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not aware of any
proceedings that are pending or threatened that may have a material effect on our business, financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings
and claims in the ordinary course of business, principally property damage, personal injury claims and
commercial disputes. We expect that these claims would be covered by insurance, subject to customary
deductibles. However, those claims, even if lacking merit, could result in the expenditure of significant
financial and managerial resources.

**Preference Shares Dividend Requirements**

Dividends on Preference Shares are payable quarterly on each of January 1, April 1, July 1 and
October 1, or the next succeeding business day, as and if declared by our board of directors out of
legally available funds for such purpose. The dividend rate for the Preference Shares is 8.75% per
annum per $25.00 of liquidation preference per share (equal to $2.18750 per annum per share). The
dividend rates are not subject to adjustment. We paid dividends to holders of our Preference Shares of
$0.546875 per share on, January 2, 2019, April 1, 2019, July 1, 2019, October 1, 2019 and January 2,
2020. Our Preference Shares dividend payment obligations impact our future liquidity needs.

As our fleet expands, we will evaluate changes to the quarterly dividend consistent with our cash
flow and liquidity position. Our policy is to pay dividends in amounts that will allow us to retain
sufficient liquidity to fund our obligations as well as execute our business plan going forward. The
declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the
requirements of Bermuda law. In addition, certain of our credit facilities impose limitations on our
ability to pay dividends. Our board of directors will determine the timing and amount of all dividend
payments based on various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and
availability, restrictions in our credit facilities and the provisions of Bermuda law. Accordingly, we
cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay quarterly dividends. See ‘‘Item 3. Key Information—
D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business’’ for a discussion of risks related to our ability to pay
dividends.

**B. Significant Changes**

See ‘‘Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 30. Subsequent Events’’ below.

**ITEM 9.** **THE OFFER AND LISTING**

_Trading on the NYSE_

Since our IPO in the United States in 2012, our common shares have been listed on the NYSE
under the symbol ‘‘GLOG’’.

Our Preference Shares have been trading on the NYSE under the symbol ‘‘GLOG PR A’’ since
March 31, 2015.

**ITEM 10.** **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

**A. Share Capital**

Our authorized share capital consists of 500,000,000 shares, par value $0.01 per share. As of
December 31, 2019, the share capital consisted of 80,993,126 issued and outstanding common shares,
par value $0.01 per share, 121,456 treasury shares and 4,600,000 issued and outstanding Preference
Shares.

Pursuant to our bye-laws, subject to any resolution of the shareholders to the contrary, our board
of directors is authorized to issue any of our authorized but unissued common shares. There are no
limitations on the right of non-Bermudians or non-residents of Bermuda to hold or vote our shares.

**B. Memorandum of Association**

We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. We are registered with
the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda under registration number 33928. We were incorporated on
July 16, 2003 under the name Gaslog Ltd. We effected a change of name from ‘‘Gaslog Ltd.’’ to
‘‘GasLog Ltd.’’ on August 23, 2011 in compliance with the Companies Act. Our registered office is
located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda.

The objects of our business are unrestricted, and the Company has the capacity of a natural
person. We can therefore undertake activities without restriction on our capacity.

**Common Shares**

Holders of our common shares have no pre-emptive, redemption, conversion or sinking fund
rights. Holders of our common shares are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a
vote of holders of common shares. Unless a different majority is required by law or by our bye-laws,
resolutions to be approved by holders of our common shares require approval by a simple majority of
votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

120


-----

In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of our common shares are
entitled to share equally and ratably in our assets, if any, remaining after the payment of all of our
debts and liabilities, subject to any liquidation preference on any issued and outstanding preference
shares.

**Preference Shares**

Pursuant to Bermuda law and our bye-laws, our board of directors by resolution may establish one
or more series of preference shares having such number of shares, designations, dividend rates, relative
voting rights, conversion or exchange rights, redemption rights, liquidation rights and other relative
participation, optional or other special rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions as may be fixed
by the board without any further shareholder approval. Of the Company’s 500 million authorised
shares, 4.6 million have been designated 8.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference
Shares.

**Dividend Rights**

Under Bermuda law, a company may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds
for believing that: (i) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they
become due; or (ii) the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Under our
bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends if, as and when dividends are declared by our
board of directors.

Any cash dividends payable to holders of our common shares listed on the NYSE will be paid to
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent in the United States for
disbursement to those holders.

**Variation of Rights**

If at any time we have more than one class of shares, the rights attaching to any class, unless
otherwise provided for by the terms of issue of the relevant class, may be varied with the sanction of a
resolution passed by a majority of the issued shares of such class. Our bye-laws specify that the creation
or issue of shares ranking equally with existing shares will not, unless expressly provided by the terms
of issue of existing shares, vary the rights attached to existing shares.

**Transfer of Shares**

Our board of directors may in its absolute discretion and without assigning any reason refuse to
register the transfer of a share that is not fully paid. Our board of directors may also refuse to
recognize an instrument of transfer of a share unless it is accompanied by the relevant share certificate
and such other evidence of the transferor’s right to make the transfer as our board of directors shall
reasonably require. In addition, our board of directors may refuse to register the transfer of a share
unless all applicable consents, authorizations and permissions of any governmental body or agency in
Bermuda have been obtained. Subject to these restrictions, a holder of common shares may transfer the
title to all or any of his common shares by completing a form of transfer in the form set out in our
bye-laws (or as near thereto as circumstances admit) or in such other common form as the board may
accept. The instrument of transfer must be signed by the transferor and transferee, although in the case
of a fully paid share our board of directors may accept the instrument signed only by the transferor.

**Meetings of Shareholders**

We are required to convene at least one general meeting of shareholders each calendar year.
Bermuda law provides that a special general meeting of shareholders may be called by the board of
directors of a company and must be called upon the request of shareholders holding not less than

121


-----

10.0% of the paid-up capital of the company carrying the right to vote at general meetings. Bermuda
law also requires that shareholders be given at least five days’ advance notice of a general meeting, but
an unintentional failure notice to any person does not invalidate the proceedings at a meeting. Our
bye-laws provide that the Chairman or our board of directors may convene an annual general meeting
or a special general meeting. Under our bye-laws, at least 10 days’ notice of an annual general meeting
or a special general meeting must be given to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting. This
notice requirement is subject to the ability to hold such meetings on shorter notice if such notice is
agreed: (i) in the case of an annual general meeting, by all of the shareholders entitled to attend and
vote at such meeting; or (ii) in the case of a special general meeting, by a majority in number of the
shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting holding not less than 95.0% in nominal value of
the shares entitled to vote at such meeting. The quorum required for a general meeting of shareholders
is one or more persons present in person throughout the meeting and representing in person or by
proxy in excess of 50.0% of all issued and outstanding common shares. General meetings can be
convened at a location in or outside of Bermuda. Our bye-laws provide that our board of directors
may, but is not required to, make arrangements permitting shareholders to participate in general
meetings by such telephonic, electronic or other communications facilities or means as permit all
persons participating in the meeting to communicate with each other simultaneously and
instantaneously.

**Access to Books and Records and Dissemination of Information**

Members of the general public have a right to inspect public documents of the Company available
at the office of the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda. These documents include the Company’s
memorandum of association, including its objects and powers, and certain alterations to the
memorandum of association. Our shareholders have the additional right to inspect the bye-laws of the
Company, minutes of general meetings and the Company’s audited financial statements, which must be
presented to the annual general meeting. The Company’s register of members is also open to
inspection by shareholders and by members of the general public without charge. The register of
members is required under Bermuda law to be open for inspection for not less than two hours in any
business day (subject to the ability of a company to close the register of members for not more than
thirty days in a year). The Company is required to maintain its share register in Bermuda but may,
subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, establish a branch register outside of Bermuda. The
Company is required to keep at its registered office a register of directors and officers that is open for
inspection for not less than two hours in any business day by members of the public without charge.
Bermuda law does not, however, provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of
any other corporate records.

**Election and Removal of Directors**

Our bye-laws provide that our board shall consist of no less than three directors and no more than
fifteen directors, as the board of directors may from time to time determine. Our board of directors
consists of nine directors.

Any shareholder wishing to propose for election as a director someone who is not an existing
director or is not proposed by our board must give notice of the intention to propose the person for
election. Where a director is to be elected at an annual general meeting, that notice must be given not
less than 90 days nor more than 120 days before the anniversary of the last annual general meeting
prior to the giving of the notice or, in the event the annual general meeting is called for a date that is
not 30 days before or after such anniversary, the notice must be given not later than 10 days following
the earlier of the date on which notice of the annual general meeting was posted to shareholders or the
date on which public disclosure of the date of the annual general meeting was made. Where a director
is to be elected at a special general meeting that notice must be given not later than 10 days following

122


-----

the earlier of the date on which notice of the special general meeting was posted to shareholders or the
date on which public disclosure of the date of the special general meeting was made.

A director may be removed by the shareholders, provided notice of the shareholders’ meeting
convened to remove the director is given to the director. The notice must contain a statement of the
intention to remove the director and must be served on the director not less than 14 days before the
meeting. The director is entitled to attend the meeting and be heard on the motion for his or her
removal.

Holders of our Preference Shares generally have no voting rights except (i) in respect of
amendments to the memorandum of association which would adversely vary the rights of the
Preference Shares, (ii) in the event that the Company proposes to issue any parity shares if the
cumulative dividends payable on issued and outstanding Preference Shares are in arrears or any senior
shares or (iii) in the event of a proposed amalgamation or merger of the Company. However, if and
whenever dividends payable on the Preference Shares are in arrears for six or more quarterly periods,
whether or not consecutive, holders of Preference Shares (voting together as a class with all other
classes or series of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are
exercisable) will be entitled to elect one additional director to serve on our board of directors, and the
size of our board of directors will be increased as needed to accommodate such change (unless the size
of our board of directors already has been increased by reason of the election of a director by holders
of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and with which the Preference
Shares voted as a class for the election of such director). The right of such holders of Preference
Shares to elect a member of our board of directors will continue until such time as all accumulated and
unpaid dividends on the Preference Shares have been paid in full.

**Proceedings of Board of Directors**

Our bye-laws provide that our business is to be managed and conducted by our board of directors.
There is no requirement in our bye-laws or Bermuda law that directors hold any of our shares. There is
also no requirement in our bye-laws or Bermuda law that our directors must retire at a certain age.

The remuneration of our directors is determined by the board of directors, and there is no
requirement that a specified number or percentage of ‘‘independent’’ directors must approve any such
determination. Our directors may also be paid all travel, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by
them in connection with our business or their duties as directors.

**Director Conflicts of Interest**

Any conflict of interest question involving one or more of the Company’s directors will be resolved
by the audit and risk committee of the board of directors.

In the event that a director has a direct or indirect interest in any contract or arrangement with
the Company, provided that the director discloses such interest as required by Bermuda law, such
director is entitled under our bye-laws to vote in respect of any such contract or arrangement in which
he or she is interested unless he or she is disqualified from voting by the Chairman of our board of
directors. In the event that the Chairman has disclosed a direct or indirect interest in a contract or
arrangement with us, the determination as to whether the Chairman and any other interested director
should be disqualified from voting will be made by a majority of the disinterested directors.

Bermuda law prohibits any director (including the spouse or children of the director or any
company of which such director, spouse or children own or control more than 20.0% of the capital or
loan debt) from borrowing from us (except loans made to directors who are bona fide employees or
former employees pursuant to an employees’ share scheme) unless shareholders holding 90.0% of the
total voting rights have consented to the loan.

**Indemnification of Directors and Officers**

Section 98 of the Companies Act provides generally that a Bermuda company may indemnify its
directors, officers and auditors against any liability which by virtue of any rule of law would otherwise
be imposed on them in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, except in
cases where such liability arises from fraud or dishonesty of which such director, officer or auditor may
be guilty in relation to the company. Section 98 further provides that a Bermuda company may
indemnify its directors, officers and auditors against any liability incurred by them in defending any
proceedings, whether civil or criminal, in which judgment is awarded in their favor or in which they are
acquitted or granted relief by the Supreme Court of Bermuda pursuant to section 281 of the
Companies Act.

We have adopted provisions in our bye-laws that provide that we shall indemnify our officers and
directors in respect of their actions and omissions, except in respect of their fraud or dishonesty. Our
bye-laws provide that the shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have,
individually or in right of the Company, against any of the Company’s directors or officers for any act
or failure to act in the performance of such director’s or officer’s duties, except in respect of any fraud
or dishonesty of such director or officer. Section 98A of the Companies Act permits us to purchase and
maintain insurance for the benefit of any officer or director in respect of any loss or liability attaching
to him in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, whether or not we may
otherwise indemnify such officer or director. We have purchased and maintain directors’ and officers’
liability insurance for such purpose. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our
directors and officers. See ‘‘Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—B. Related
Party Transactions’’.

**Amendment of Memorandum of Association and Bye-laws**

Bermuda law provides that the memorandum of association of a company may be amended by a
resolution passed at a general meeting of shareholders. Our bye-laws provide that no bye-law shall be
rescinded, altered or amended, and no new bye-law shall be made, unless it shall have been approved
by a resolution of our board of directors and by a resolution of our shareholders including the
affirmative votes of at least a majority of all issued and outstanding shares.

Under Bermuda law, the holders of an aggregate of not less than 20.0% in par value of a
company’s issued share capital or any class thereof have the right to apply to the Supreme Court of
Bermuda for an annulment of any amendment of the memorandum of association adopted by
shareholders at any general meeting, other than an amendment which alters or reduces a company’s
share capital as provided in the Companies Act. Where such an application is made, the amendment
becomes effective only to the extent that it is confirmed by the Bermuda court. An application for an
annulment of an amendment of the memorandum of association must be made within twenty-one days
after the date on which the resolution altering the company’s memorandum of association is passed and
may be made on behalf of persons entitled to make the application by one or more of their number as
they may appoint in writing for the purpose. No application may be made by shareholders voting in
favor of the amendment.

**Amalgamations, Mergers and Business Combinations**

The amalgamation or merger of a Bermuda company with another company or corporation (other
than certain affiliated companies) requires the amalgamation or merger agreement to be approved by
the company’s board of directors and by its shareholders. Unless the company’s bye-laws provide
otherwise, the approval of 75.0% of the shareholders voting at such meeting is required to approve the
amalgamation or merger agreement, and the quorum for such meeting must be two persons holding or
representing more than one-third of the issued shares of the company. Our bye-laws provide that a

124


-----

merger or an amalgamation must only be approved by the affirmative votes of a majority of the votes
attaching to all issued and outstanding shares entitling the shareholder to vote on such resolutions.

Under Bermuda law, in the event of an amalgamation or merger of a Bermuda company with
another company or corporation, a shareholder of the Bermuda company who did not vote in favor of
the amalgamation or merger and who is not satisfied that fair value has been offered for such
shareholder’s shares may, within one month of notice of the shareholders’ meeting, apply to the
Supreme Court of Bermuda to appraise the fair value of those shares.

**Shareholder Suits**

Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under Bermuda law.
The Bermuda courts, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an
action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is
alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal, or would result in the violation of
the company’s memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by
a Bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for
instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company’s shareholders
than that which actually approved it.

When the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or prejudicial
to the interests of some part of the shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Supreme
Court of Bermuda, which may make such order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct
of the company’s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by
other shareholders or by the company.

Our bye-laws contain a provision which provides that in the event any dispute arises concerning
the Companies Act or out of our bye-laws, including whether there has been a breach of the
Companies Act or our bye-laws by an officer or director, any such dispute shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Bermuda. In addition, our bye-laws contain a provision
by virtue of which our shareholders waive any claim or right of action that they have, both individually
and on our behalf, against any director or officer in relation to any action or failure to take action by
such director or officer, except in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer.

**Capitalization of Profits and Reserves**

Pursuant to our bye-laws, our board of directors may (i) capitalize any part of the amount of our
share premium or other reserve accounts or any amount credited to our profit and loss account or
otherwise available for distribution by applying such sum in paying up unissued shares to be allotted as
fully paid bonus shares pro rata (except in connection with the conversion of shares) to the
shareholders; or (ii) capitalize any sum standing to the credit of a reserve account or sums otherwise
available for dividend or distribution by paying up in full, partly paid or nil paid shares of those
shareholders who would have been entitled to such sums if they were distributed by way of dividend or
distribution.

**Calls on Shares and Forfeiture**

In the event of any issuance by the Company of shares that are not fully paid, our board of
directors may make such calls as it thinks fit upon the holders of such partly paid shares in respect of
any amounts unpaid on such shares (and not made payable at fixed times by the terms and conditions
of issue). If a call on partly paid shares is not paid on or before the day appointed for payment thereof,
the holder of such shares may at the discretion of our board of directors be liable to pay the Company
interest on the amount of such call and our board of directors may direct the secretary of the Company
to forward such shareholder a notice in writing demanding payment. If the requirements of such notice

125


-----

are not complied with, any such share may at any time thereafter, until the payment of all amounts
due, be forfeited by a resolution of our board of directors to that effect, and such share shall thereupon
become the property of the Company and may be disposed of as our board of directors shall
determine.

**Untraced Shareholders**

Our bye-laws provide that our board of directors may forfeit any dividend or other monies payable
in respect of any shares that remain unclaimed for six years from the date when such monies became
due for payment. In addition, we are entitled to cease sending dividend warrants and checks by post or
otherwise to a shareholder if such instruments have been returned undelivered to, or left uncashed by,
such shareholder on at least two consecutive occasions or, following one such occasion, reasonable
enquires have failed to establish the shareholder’s new address. This entitlement ceases if the
shareholder claims a dividend or cashes a dividend check or a warrant.

**Certain Provisions of Bermuda Law**

We have been designated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as a non-resident for Bermuda
exchange control purposes. This designation allows us to engage in transactions in currencies other than
the Bermuda dollar, and there are no exchange control restrictions on our ability to transfer funds
(other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S.
residents who are holders of our common shares or our Preference Shares.

The Bermuda Monetary Authority has given its consent for the issue and free transferability of all
our common shares to and between non-residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes, provided
that our shares remain listed on an appointed stock exchange, which includes the NYSE. Approvals or
permissions given by the Bermuda Monetary Authority do not constitute a guarantee by the Bermuda
Monetary Authority as to our performance or our creditworthiness. Accordingly, in giving such consent
or permissions, the Bermuda Monetary Authority shall not be liable for the financial soundness,
performance or default of our business or for the correctness of any opinions or statements expressed
in this annual report. Certain issues and transfers of common shares involving persons deemed resident
in Bermuda for exchange control purposes require the specific consent of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority.

In accordance with Bermuda law, share certificates are only issued in the names of companies,
partnerships or individuals. In the case of a shareholder acting in a special capacity (for example as a
trustee), certificates may, at the request of the shareholder, record the capacity in which the
shareholder is acting. Notwithstanding such recording of any special capacity, we are not bound to
investigate or see to the execution of any such trust. We will take no notice of any trust applicable to
any of our shares, whether or not we have been notified of such trust.

**C. Material Contracts**

The following is a summary of each material contract, other than contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business, to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party. Such summaries are not

**D. Exchange Controls and Other Limitations Affecting Security Holders**

Under Bermuda law, there are currently no restrictions on the export or import of capital,
including foreign exchange controls or restrictions that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or
other payments to non-resident holders of our common shares.

128


-----

We have been designated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as a non-resident for Bermuda
exchange control purposes. This designation allows us to engage in transactions in currencies other than
the Bermuda dollar, and there are no exchange control restrictions on our ability to transfer funds
(other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to U.S.
residents who are holders of our common shares.

Under Bermuda law, ‘‘exempted’’ companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting
business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As an exempted company, we
may not, without a license or consent granted by the Minister of Finance, participate in certain business
transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of
business of any kind, for which we are not licensed in Bermuda.

**E. Tax Considerations**

**Bermuda Tax Considerations**

The following discussion summarizes the material Bermuda tax consequences to us of our activities
and, subject to the limitations described above, to you as a holder of our shares. At the present time,
there is no Bermuda income or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate
duty or inheritance tax payable by us or by our shareholders in respect of our shares. We have obtained
an assurance from the Minister of Finance of Bermuda under the Exempted Undertakings Tax
Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, as amended, that, in the event that any legislation is enacted in
Bermuda imposing any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or
appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax shall not, until
March 31, 2035, be applicable to us or to any of our operations or to our shares, debentures or other
obligations except insofar as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or is payable by
us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in Bermuda. Given the limited duration of the
Bermuda Minister of Finance’s assurance, we can give no assurance that we will not be subject to any
Bermuda tax after March 31, 2035.

**Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. Federal income tax consequences to us of
our activities and, subject to the limitations described above, to you as a holder of our common shares
or Preference Shares. For purposes of this tax discussion, ‘‘we’’ or ‘‘our’’ refer to GasLog Ltd.

The following discussion of U.S. Federal income tax matters is based on the Code, judicial
decisions, administrative pronouncements, and existing and proposed regulations issued by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This
discussion does not address any U.S. state or local taxes. You are encouraged to consult your own tax
advisor regarding the particular U.S. Federal, state and local and foreign income and other tax
consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of our common shares or Preference Shares that may
be applicable to you.

**_U.S. Taxation of Our Operating Income_**

We have elected to treat a majority of our subsidiaries as disregarded entities for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes. The entities that are considered disregarded entities for U.S. Federal income tax
purposes should be treated as branches rather than corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.
Currently, no election has been filed to treat GasLog LNG Services Ltd., GasLog Services UK Ltd.,
GasLog Asia Pte. Ltd., GasLog Investments Ltd., GasLog Monaco S.A.M., GasLog Shipping Limited,
GasLog Shipping Company Ltd., and Egypt LNG Shipping Ltd. as disregarded entities for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes. As a result, these entities and GasLog Services U.S. Inc. will continue to be
treated as corporations for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

_U.S. Taxation of Shipping Income_

Subject to the discussion of ‘‘effectively connected’’ income below, unless we are exempt from U.S.
Federal income tax under the rules contained in Section 883 of the Code, we will be subject to U.S.
Federal income tax under the rules of Section 887 of the Code, which imposes on us a 4% U.S.
Federal income tax in respect of our U.S. source gross transportation income (without the allowance
for deductions).

For this purpose, U.S. source gross transportation income includes 50% of the shipping income
that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends (but that does not both begin and end) in the
United States. Shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non-U.S. ports is
generally not subject to any U.S. Federal income tax.

For this purpose, ‘‘shipping income’’ means income that is derived from:

(i) the use of ships;

(ii) the hiring or leasing of ships for use on a time, operating or bareboat charter basis;

(iii) the participation in a pool, partnership, strategic alliance, joint operating agreement or other
joint venture we directly or indirectly own or participate in that generates such income; or

(iv) the performance of services directly related to those uses.

Under Section 883 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, we will be exempt from U.S.
Federal income tax on our U.S. source gross transportation income if:

(i) we are organized in a foreign country (the ‘‘country of organization’’) that grants an
‘‘equivalent exemption’’ to corporations organized in the United States; and

(ii) either

(a) more than 50% of the value of our shares is owned, directly or indirectly, by individuals
who are ‘‘residents’’ of our country of organization or of another foreign country that
grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States (the ‘‘50%
Ownership Test’’), or

(b) our shares are ‘‘primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market’’ in our
country of organization, in another country that grants an equivalent exemption to U.S.
corporations, or in the United States (the ‘‘Publicly-Traded Test’’).

We have qualified for the statutory tax exemption for the year of 2019 and intend to continue to
qualify for the foreseeable future. However, no assurance can be given that this will be the case. If we
are not entitled to this exemption under Section 883 for any taxable year we would be subject to the
4% U.S. Federal income (subject to the discussion of ‘‘effectively connected income’’ below).

To the extent the exemption under Section 883 is unavailable, our U.S. source gross transportation
income in future years that is considered to be ‘‘effectively connected’’ with the conduct of a U.S. trade
or business is subject to the U.S. corporate income tax currently imposed at rate of up to 21% (net of
applicable deductions). In addition, we may be subject to the 30% U.S. ‘‘branch profits’’ tax on
earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business, as determined after
allowance for certain adjustments, and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the
conduct of our U.S. trade or business.

Our U.S. source gross transportation income would be considered effectively connected with the
conduct of a U.S. trade or business only if:

(i) we had, or were considered to have, a fixed place of business in the United States involved in
the earning of U.S. source gross transportation income; and

130


-----

(ii) substantially all of our U.S. source gross transportation income was attributable to regularly
scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a ship that followed a published schedule
with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or
end in the United States.

We believe that we will not meet these conditions because we will not have, or permit
circumstances that would result in having, such a fixed place of business in the United States or any
ship sailing to or from the United States on a regularly scheduled basis.

In addition, income attributable to transportation that both begins and ends in the United States is
not subject to the tax rules described above. Such income is subject to either a 30% gross-basis tax or
to U.S. corporate income tax on net income at a rate of up to 21% (and the branch profits tax
discussed above). Although there can be no assurance, we do not expect to engage in transportation
that produces shipping income of this type.

_Taxation of Gain on Sale of Shipping Assets_

Regardless of whether we qualify for the exemption under Section 883 of the Code, we will not be
subject to U.S. Federal income taxation with respect to gain realized on a sale of a ship, provided the
sale is considered to occur outside of the United States (as determined under U.S. tax principles). In
general, a sale of a ship will be considered to occur outside of the United States for this purpose if title
to the ship (and risk of loss with respect to the ship) passes to the buyer outside of the United States.
We expect that any sale of a ship will be so structured that it will be considered to occur outside of the
United States.

**_U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders_**

You are a ‘‘U.S. holder’’ if you are a beneficial owner of our common shares or Preference Shares
that owns (actually or constructively) less than 10% of our equity and you are (i) a U.S. citizen or
resident, (ii) a U.S. corporation (or other U.S. entity taxable as a corporation), (iii) an estate the
income of which is subject to U.S. Federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if
(x) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of
the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust or (y) the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

If a partnership holds our common shares or Preference Shares, the tax treatment of a partner will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. If you are a
partner in a partnership holding our common shares or Preference Shares, you should consult your tax
advisor.

_Distributions on Our Common Shares and Preference Shares_

Subject to the discussion of ‘‘passive foreign investment companies’’, or ‘‘PFICs’’, below, any
distributions with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares that you receive from us
generally will constitute dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits
(as determined under U.S. tax principles). Distributions in excess of our earnings and profits will be
treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of your tax basis in our common shares or
Preference Shares (on a dollar-for-dollar basis) and thereafter as capital gain.

If you are a U.S. corporation (or a U.S. entity taxable as a corporation), you generally will not be
entitled to claim a dividends-received deduction with respect to any distributions you receive from us.

Dividends paid with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares will generally be treated
as ‘‘passive category income’’ for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for U.S. foreign
tax credit purposes.

131


-----

If you are an individual, trust or estate, dividends you receive from us should be treated as
‘‘qualified dividend income’’ taxed at a maximum preferential rate of 15% or 20%, depending on the
income level of the individual, provided that:

(i) our common shares or Preference Shares, as the case may be, are readily tradable on an
established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE);

(ii) we are not a PFIC for the tax year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately
preceding tax year (see the discussion below under ‘‘—PFIC Status and Significant Tax
Consequences’’);

(iii) you own our common shares or Preference Shares for more than 60 days in the 121-day
period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common shares or Preference Shares
become ex-dividend;

(iv) you are not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in
substantially similar or related property; and

(v) certain other conditions are met.

Special rules may apply to any ‘‘extraordinary dividend’’. Generally, an extraordinary dividend is a
dividend in an amount that is equal to (or in excess of) 10% of your adjusted tax basis (or fair market
value in certain circumstances) in a share of our common shares (5% in the case of Preference Shares).
If we pay an extraordinary dividend on our common shares or Preference Shares that is treated as
‘‘qualified dividend income’’ and if you are an individual, estate or trust, then any loss derived by you
from a subsequent sale or exchange of such common shares or Preference Shares will be treated as
long-term capital loss to the extent of such dividend.

There is no assurance that dividends you receive from us will be eligible for the preferential tax
rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Dividends you receive from us that are not eligible for
the preferential tax rates will be taxed at the ordinary income rates.

_Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Common Shares and Preference Shares_

Provided that we are not a PFIC for any tax year, you generally will recognize taxable gain or loss
upon a sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares in an amount
equal to the difference between the amount realized by you from such sale, exchange or other
disposition and your tax basis in such shares. Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain
or loss if your holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other
disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S. source income or loss, as
applicable, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Your ability to deduct capital losses against ordinary
income is subject to limitations.

_Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax_

Each U.S. holder who is an individual, estate or trust is generally subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax
on the lesser of (i) such U.S. holder’s ‘‘net investment income’’ for the relevant tax year, and (ii) the
excess of such U.S. holder’s modified adjusted gross income for the tax year over a certain threshold
(which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s
circumstances). For this purpose, net investment income generally includes dividends on and capital
gains from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares, subject
to certain exceptions. You are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability of
the Medicare tax to your income and gains from your ownership of our common shares or Preference
Shares.

_PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences_

_In General_

Special U.S. Federal income tax rules apply to you if you hold shares in a non-U.S. corporation
that is classified as a PFIC for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. In general, under Section 1297 of the
Code, we will be treated as a PFIC in any tax year in which, after applying certain look-through rules,
either:

(i) at least 75% of our gross income including our proportionate share of the gross income of our
vessel-owning subsidiaries for such tax year consists of passive income (e.g., dividends, interest,
capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business); or

(ii) at least 50% of the average value of our assets including our proportionate share of the assets
of our vessel-owning subsidiaries during such tax year that produce, or are held for the
production of, passive income.

Income we earn, or are deemed to earn, in connection with the performance of services will not
constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income will generally constitute passive income (unless we
are treated under certain special rules as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or
business).

There are legal uncertainties involved in determining whether the income derived from time
chartering activities constitutes rental income or income derived from the performance of services. In
_Tidewater Inc. v. United States, 565 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit held that income derived_
from certain time chartering activities should be treated as rental income rather than services income
for purposes of a provision of the Code relating to foreign sales corporations. In published guidance,
however, the IRS stated that it disagreed with the holding in Tidewater, and specified that time charters
should be treated as service contracts. Since we have chartered all our ships to unrelated charterers on
the basis of time charters and since we expect to continue to do so, we believe that we are not a PFIC.
We have received an opinion from our counsel, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, that (i) the income we
receive from time charters and the assets engaged in generating such income should not be treated as
passive income or assets which produce (or are held for the production of) passive income, respectively,
and (ii) we should currently not be a PFIC and in the future, assuming no material change in the
nature of our activities and assets. This opinion is based and its accuracy is conditioned on
representations, valuations and projections provided by us regarding the nature of our assets, income
and charters to our counsel. While we believe these representations, valuations and projections to be
accurate, the shipping market is volatile and no assurance can be given that they will continue to be
accurate. Moreover, we have not sought, and we do not expect to seek, an IRS ruling on this matter.
As a result, the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. No assurance can be given that this
result will not occur. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid, to
the extent possible, being classified as a PFIC with respect to any tax year, we can give no assurance
that the nature of our operations will not change in the future, or that we can avoid PFIC status in the
future.

If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year, you generally would be subject to one of three
different U.S. Federal income tax regimes, as discussed below, depending on whether or not you make
certain elections. Additionally, for each year during which you own our common shares or Preference
Shares, we are a PFIC and the total value of all PFIC stock that you directly or indirectly own exceeds
certain thresholds, you will be required to file IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. Federal income tax return
to report your ownership of our common shares or Preference Shares.

The PFIC rules are complex, and you are encouraged to consult your own tax advisor regarding
the PFIC rules, including the annual PFIC reporting requirement.

_Taxation of U.S. Holders Making a Timely QEF Election_

If we were a PFIC and if you make a timely election to treat us as a ‘‘Qualifying Electing Fund’’
for U.S. tax purposes (a ‘‘QEF Election’’), you would be required to report each year your pro rata
share of our ordinary earnings and our net capital gain for our tax year that ends with or within your
tax year, regardless of whether we make any distributions to you. Such income inclusions would not be
eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income (as discussed above under
‘‘U.S. Federal Income Taxation of U.S. Holders—Distributions on Our Common Shares and Preference
Shares’’). Your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares would be increased to
reflect such taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that had
previously been taxed would result in a corresponding reduction in your adjusted tax basis in our
common shares or Preference Shares and would not be taxed again once distributed. You generally
would recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares
or Preference Shares. Even if you make a QEF Election for one of our tax years, if we were a PFIC
for a prior tax year during which you held our common shares or Preference Shares and for which you
did not make a timely QEF Election, you would also be subject to a more adverse regime described
below under ‘‘—Taxation of U.S. Holders That Make No Election’’.

You would make a QEF Election by completing and filing IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. Federal
income tax return for the year for which the election is made in accordance with the relevant
instructions. If we were to become aware that we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year, we
would notify all U.S. holders of such treatment and would provide all necessary information to any U.S.
holder who requests such information in order to make the QEF Election described above with respect
to us.

_Taxation of U.S. Holders Making a Timely ‘‘Mark-to-Market’’ Election_

Alternatively, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any tax year and, as we believe, our common
shares or Preference Shares are treated as ‘‘marketable stock’’, you would be allowed to make a
‘‘mark-to-market’’ election with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares, provided you
complete and file IRS Form 8621 with your U.S. Federal income tax return for the year for which the
election is made in accordance with the relevant instructions. If that election is made, you generally
would include as ordinary income in each tax year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of our
common shares or Preference Shares at the end of the tax year over your adjusted tax basis in our
common shares or Preference Shares. You also would be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the
excess, if any, of your adjusted tax basis in our common shares or Preference Shares over its fair
market value at the end of the tax year (but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in
income as a result of the mark-to-market election). Your tax basis in our common shares or Preference
Shares would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount. Gain realized on the sale,
exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares would be treated as ordinary
income, and any loss realized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the common shares or
Preference Shares would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the
net mark-to-market gains previously included by you.

_Taxation of U.S. Holders That Make No Election_

Finally, if we were treated as a PFIC for any tax year and if you did not make either a QEF
Election or a ‘‘mark-to-market’’ election for that year, you would be subject to special rules with
respect to (i) any excess distribution (that is, the portion of any distributions received by you on our
common shares or Preference Shares in a tax year in excess of 125% of the average annual
distributions received by you in the three preceding tax years, or, if shorter, your holding period for our

134


-----

common shares or Preference Shares) and (ii) any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other
disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares. Under these special rules:

(i) the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over your aggregate holding period
for our common shares or Preference Shares;

(ii) the amount allocated to the current tax year and any tax year prior to the tax year we were
first treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. holder who does not make a QEF Election
or a ‘‘mark-to-market’’ election would be taxed as ordinary income; and

(iii) the amount allocated to each of the other tax years would be subject to tax at the highest rate
of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year, and an interest charge for the
deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to
each such other tax year.

**_U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders_**

You are a ‘‘non-U.S. holder’’ if you are a beneficial owner of our common shares or Preference
Shares (other than a partnership for U.S. tax purposes) and you are not a U.S. holder.

_Distributions on Our Common Shares and Preference Shares_

You generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income or withholding taxes on a distribution
received from us with respect to our common shares or Preference Shares, unless the income arising
from such distribution is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States. If you are entitled to the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty with respect to that income,
that income generally is taxable in the United States only if it is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by you in the United States.

_Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Our Common Shares and Preference Shares_

You generally will not be subject to U.S. Federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain
realized upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common shares or Preference Shares,
unless:

(i) the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
If you are entitled to the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty with respect to that gain,
that gain generally is taxable in the United States only if it is attributable to a permanent
establishment maintained by you in the United States; or

(ii) you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the tax
year of disposition and certain other conditions are met.

Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or
so treated) generally will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax (net of certain deductions) at regular
U.S. Federal income tax rates. If you are a corporate non-U.S. holder, your earnings and profits that
are attributable to the effectively connected income (subject to certain adjustments) may be subject to
an additional U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an
applicable tax treaty).

135

**_United States Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

_In General_

In general, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, dividend payments (or other taxable
distributions) made within the United States will be subject to information reporting requirements.
Backup withholding may apply to such payments if you:

(i) fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number;

(ii) are notified by the IRS that you have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be
shown on your U.S. Federal income tax returns; or

(iii) in certain circumstances, fail to comply with applicable certification requirements.

If you are a non-U.S. holder, you may be required to establish your exemption from information
reporting and backup withholding by certifying your status on IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E,
W-8ECI or W-8IMY, as applicable.

If you sell our common shares or Preference Shares to or through a U.S. office or broker, the
payment of the sales proceeds is subject to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting
unless you certify that you are a non-U.S. person, under penalties of perjury, or you otherwise establish
an exemption. If you sell our common shares or Preference Shares through a non-U.S. office of a
non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then information
reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment.

However, U.S. information reporting requirements (but not backup withholding) will apply to a
payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell our
common shares or Preference Shares through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or has
certain other connections with the United States.

Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax. Rather, you generally may obtain a credit for any
amount withheld against its liability for U.S.federal income tax (and obtain a refund of any amounts
withheld in excess of such liability) by accurately completing and timely filing certain required
information with the IRS.

_Tax Return Disclosure_

U.S. individuals who hold certain ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’ (which include shares in a
foreign corporation) with values in excess of certain dollar thresholds are subject to U.S. return
disclosure obligations (and related penalties for failure to disclose). Such U.S. individuals are required
to file IRS Form 8938 with their U.S. Federal income tax returns. Regulations extend this reporting
requirement to certain entities that are treated as formed or availed of to hold direct or indirect
interests in specified foreign financial assets based on certain objective criteria. You are encouraged to
consult your own tax advisors concerning the filing of IRS Form 8938.

**ITEM 13.** **DEFAULTS, DIVIDEND ARREARAGES AND DELINQUENCIES**

There has been no material default in the payment of principal, interest, sinking or purchase fund
installments or any other material default relating to the Group’s debt. There have been no arrears in
payment of dividends on, or material delinquency with respect to, any class of preference shares of the
Group.

**ITEM 14.** **MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS TO THE RIGHTS OF SECURITY HOLDERS AND USE**
**OF PROCEEDS**

On June 24, 2019, we and the Partnership entered into an agreement to eliminate the IDRs in
exchange for the issuance by the Partnership to GasLog of 2,532,911 common units and 2,490,000
Class B units (of which 415,000 are Class B-1 units, 415,000 are Class B-2 units, 415,000 are Class B-3
units, 415,000 are Class B-4 units, 415,000 are Class B-5 units and 415,000 are Class B-6 units), issued
on June 30, 2019. Class B units have all of the rights and obligations attached to the common units,
except for voting rights and participation in distributions until such time as GasLog exercises its right to
convert the Class B units to common units. The Class B units will become eligible for conversion on a
one-for-one basis into common units at GasLog’s option on July 1, 2020, July 1, 2021, July 1, 2022,
July 1, 2023, July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025 for the Class B-1 units, Class B-2 units, Class B-3 units,
Class B-4 units, Class B-5 units and the Class B-6 units, respectively. Following the IDR elimination,
the allocation of GasLog’s profit to non-controlling interests is based on the revised distribution policy
for available cash stated in the Partnership Agreement as amended, effective June 30, 2019, and under
which 98.0% of the available cash is distributed to the common unitholders and 2.0% is distributed to
the general partner.

**ITEM 15.** **CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**

**A. Disclosure Controls and Procedures**

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of December 31,
2019. Based on our evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019.

**B. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act and
for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our internal controls
over financial reporting are designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with IFRS and
that our receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of our
management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely

138


-----

detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting, misstatements may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting using criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on the
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2019.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

**C. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm**

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2019 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which appears below.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of GasLog Ltd.

**Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of GasLog Ltd and subsidiaries (the
‘‘Company’’) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
_Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission_
(COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
_Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO._

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated March 6, 2020, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

**Basis for Opinion**

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities
laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal

139


-----

control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**ITEM 16.G.** **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**

**Statement of Significant Differences Between Our Corporate Governance Practices and the NYSE**
**Corporate Governance Standards for U.S. Non-Controlled Issuers**

**_Overview_**

Pursuant to certain exceptions for foreign private issuers, we are not required to comply with
certain of the corporate governance practices followed by U.S. companies under the NYSE listing
standards. However, pursuant to Section 303.A.11 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and the
requirements of Form 20-F, we are required to state any significant ways in which our corporate
governance practices differ from the practices required by the NYSE for U.S. companies. We believe
that our established practices in the area of corporate governance are in line with the spirit of the
NYSE standards and provide adequate protection to our shareholders. The significant differences
between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE standards applicable to listed U.S.
companies are set forth below.

**_Corporate Governance, Nominating Committee_**

Pursuant to NYSE Rules 303A.04 and 303A.05, the NYSE requires that a listed U.S. company
have a nominating/corporate governance committee and a compensation committee, each composed
entirely of independent directors. The NYSE rules do not require foreign private issuers like us to
establish a nominating/corporate governance committee. Similarly, under Bermuda law, we are not
required to have a nominating/corporate governance committee. Accordingly, we do not have a
nominating/corporate governance committee.

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of GasLog Ltd.

**Opinion on the Financial Statements**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of GasLog Ltd. and
subsidiaries (‘‘the Company’’) as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, the related consolidated statements
of profit or loss, comprehensive income or loss, changes in equity and cash flows, for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
‘‘financial statements’’). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in
conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated March 6, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

**Basis for Opinion**

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Critical Audit Matter**

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the
financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee
and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and
(2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and
we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the
critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

**Tangible fixed assets—Impairment of vessels—Refer to Notes 2 and 6 to the financial statements**

_Critical Audit Matter Description_

The carrying value of vessels as of December 31, 2019, was $4,407.2 million, net of impairment losses
of $162.1 million recognized in 2019.

The Company’s vessels are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For each vessel for which impairment indicators are
identified, management estimates the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost to
sell and value in use, and compares it to the carrying value. The Company assesses value in use using
discounted future cash flows, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions, the most
significant of which are charter rates for non-contracted revenue days and the discount rate.
Management identifies these as key assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment assessment is
most sensitive.

In its impairment assessment as of December 31, 2019, the Company revised its assumptions for
charter rates for non-contracted revenue days and for discount rates. For Steam vessels, management’s
assumptions for charter rates for non-contracted revenue days decreased from an average of
$58 thousand per day to $41 thousand per day, and management’s average discount rate assumption
increased to 7.25%, resulting in impairment losses of $162.1 million recognized on the Company’s six
Steam vessels. The estimated recoverable amount of all other non-Steam vessels for which impairment
indicators were identified exceeded their carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, no
impairment was recognized for non-Steam vessels.

We identified impairment of vessels as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made
by management to estimate the discount rate and the charter rates for non-contracted revenue days,
which are particularly subjective as they involve assumptions about the LNG shipping market through
the end of the useful lives of the vessels, and due to the sensitivity of the value in use calculations to
management’s assumptions. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of
management’s estimates of charter rates for non-contracted revenue days and the discount rate
required a high degree of auditor judgment.

_How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_

Our audit procedures related to the charter rate assumptions for non-contracted revenue days and the
discount rate used by management to estimate the recoverable amount of vessels included the
following:

-  We tested the controls over management’s estimation of the recoverable amount of vessels for which
impairment indicators were identified, including controls over the assumptions for the charter rate
for non-contracted revenue days and the discount rate.

-  With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate,
including: management’s estimation method; testing the source information underlying the
determination of the discount rate; the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate calculation; and
developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by
management.

-  We evaluated the reasonableness of charter rates for non-contracted revenue days up to
December 31, 2024 by comparing management’s assumptions for each vessel type to market data,
and considered actual time charters agreed with charterers for similar vessels.

F-3


-----

-  We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s charter rate assumptions from January 1, 2025
through the end of each vessel’s useful life, for which very limited observable market data is
available, by evaluating management’s rationale and evidence for these assumptions, as follows:

– We compared them with management’s assumptions for the period up to December 31, 2024 for
which market data was available, and assessed the reasonableness of the changes in
management’s charter rate assumptions over the forecast period in light of evidence gathered
about the potential future evolution of the LNG shipping market, including forecasts and reports
published by external industry experts.

– We assessed the rationale and evidence for the estimated long run costs of building and
financing newbuild LNG vessels and the differential between the longer term charter rates for
each vessel type assumed by management, including comparison to historic new build prices,
comparison of the differentials to actual charter rates and to market data available about nearer
term charter rates, with particular focus on the charter rate differentials between Steam and
non-Steam vessels.

-  We also considered other relevant evidence, including shipbrokers’ estimates of market values of
Steam vessels that were lower than management’s estimates of values in use as of December 31,
2019.

-  We compared management’s current assumptions for the charter rate for non-contracted revenue
days and the discount rate against management’s previous assumptions, and evaluated the rationale
and evidence for changes in those assumptions based on observable trends in the LNG shipping
market.

-  We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s value in use calculations, and agreed the
inputs to the source information and underlying assumptions used by management.

-  We assessed the sensitivity disclosures in Note 6 based on our own sensitivity analysis, and checked
management’s calculations of those sensitivities.

-  We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to
management’s historical forecasts.

**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**1. Organization and Operations**

GasLog Ltd. (‘‘GasLog’’) was incorporated in Bermuda on July 16, 2003. GasLog and its
subsidiaries (the ‘‘Group’’) are primarily engaged in the ownership, operation and management of
vessels in the liquefied natural gas (‘‘LNG’’) market, providing maritime services for the transportation
of LNG on a worldwide basis and LNG vessel management services. The Group conducts its operations
through its vessel-owning subsidiaries and through its vessel management services subsidiary. The
Group’s operations are carried out from offices in Piraeus, London, New York, Singapore and Monaco.
The registered office of GasLog is Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda.
GasLog’s chairman, Peter G. Livanos, is GasLog’s largest shareholder through his ownership of Ceres
Shipping Ltd. (‘‘Ceres Shipping’’), which controls Blenheim Holdings Ltd. As of December 31, 2019,
entities controlled by members of the Livanos family, including GasLog’s chairman, are deemed to
beneficially own approximately 40.5% of GasLog’s issued and outstanding common shares. As a result
of his ownership of GasLog’s common shares, Mr. Livanos can effectively control the outcome of most
matters on which GasLog’s shareholders are entitled to vote.

On May 12, 2014, GasLog Partners LP (‘‘GasLog Partners’’ or the ‘‘Partnership’’), a subsidiary of
GasLog, completed its initial public offering (the ‘‘GasLog Partners’ IPO’’) with the sale and issuance
of 9,660,000 common units (including 1,260,000 units in relation to the overallotment option exercised
in full by the underwriters), resulting in net proceeds of $186,029 and representing a 48.2% ownership
interest. Concurrently with the GasLog Partners’ IPO, the Partnership acquired from GasLog a 100%
ownership interest in GAS-three Ltd., GAS-four Ltd. and GAS-five Ltd., the entities that own the
_GasLog Shanghai, the_ _GasLog Santiago and the GasLog Sydney, in exchange for (i) 162,358 common_
units and 9,822,358 subordinated units issued to GasLog representing a 49.8% ownership interest and
all of the incentive distribution rights that entitle GasLog to increasing percentages of the cash that the
Partnership distributes in excess of $0.43125 per unit per quarter, (ii) 400,913 general partner units
issued to GasLog Partners GP LLC (the ‘‘general partner’’), a wholly owned subsidiary of GasLog,
representing a 2.0% general partner interest and (iii) $65,695 of cash consideration paid directly to
GasLog from the GasLog Partners’ IPO proceeds.

Since GasLog Partners’ IPO, the Partnership acquired 100% of the ownership interests in the
following GasLog subsidiaries that own the vessels listed below:

**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**1. Organization and Operations (Continued)**

As of December 31, 2019, GasLog holds a 35.5% ownership interest (including the 2% interest
through general partner units) in GasLog Partners and, as a result of its ownership of the general
partner and the fact that the general partner elects the majority of the Partnership’s directors in
accordance with the Partnership Agreement, GasLog has the ability to control the Partnership’s affairs
and policies. Consequently, GasLog Partners is consolidated in the Group’s financial statements.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of GasLog
and its subsidiaries. Unless indicated otherwise, the subsidiaries listed below were 100% held (either
directly or indirectly) by GasLog. As of December 31, 2019, the Group’s structure is as follows:

(1) For newbuildings, expected delivery quarters as of December 31, 2019 are presented.

(2) In June 2019, the newbuilding _GasLog Warsaw, delivered on July 31, 2019, was transferred from GAS-twenty nine Ltd. to the subsidiary GasLog_
Hellas-1 Special Maritime Enterprise.

On October 1, 2015, GasLog Carriers, Dynagas Ltd. (‘‘Dynagas’’) and Golar LNG Ltd. (‘‘Golar’’)
(‘‘Pool Owners’’) and The Cool Pool Limited signed an LNG carrier pooling agreement (the ‘‘LNG
Carrier Pool’’ or ‘‘Pool Agreement’’ or ‘‘Cool Pool’’) to market their vessels operating in the LNG
shipping spot market. For the operation of the Cool Pool, a Marshall Islands service company named
‘‘The Cool Pool Limited’’ or the ‘‘Pool Manager’’, was incorporated in September 2015 acting as an
agent. In June and July 2018, Dynagas removed its three vessels from the Cool Pool and ceased to be a
shareholder.

On June 6, 2019, GasLog entered into a termination agreement with the Cool Pool, whereby
GasLog would assume commercial control of its six vessels operating in the LNG carrier spot market
through the Cool Pool and on June 28, 2019, GasLog transferred to Golar its 100 shares of the
common capital stock of The Cool Pool Limited. Following expiry of their commitments, GasLog
vessels were withdrawn from the Cool Pool in June and July 2019.

All entities in the Group have a December 31st year end. During 2019, the Group employed an
average of 163 employees (2018: 172 and 2017: 184).

GasLog’s common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (‘‘NYSE’’) under the ticker
symbol ‘‘GLOG’’. GasLog’s 8.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preference Shares
(‘‘Preference Shares’’) are traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ‘‘GLOG PR A’’.

**2. Significant Accounting Policies**

**_Statement of compliance_**

The consolidated financial statements of GasLog and its subsidiaries have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (the ‘‘IFRS’’) as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (the ‘‘IASB’’).

**_Basis of preparation and approval_**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for
the revaluation of derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the
fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

**_Going concern_**

In considering going concern management has reviewed the Group’s future cash requirements,
covenant compliance and earnings projections. As of December 31, 2019, the Group’s current assets
totaled $315,796, while current liabilities totaled $437,538, resulting in a negative working capital
position of $121,742.

Management anticipates that the Group’s primary sources of funds will be available cash, cash
from operations and borrowings under existing and new loan agreements. The Group may also seek to
raise additional equity. Management believes that these sources of funds will be sufficient for the
Group to meet its liquidity needs and comply with its banking covenants for at least twelve months
from the end of the reporting period and therefore it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements
on a going concern basis.

The financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars (‘‘USD’’), which is the functional currency of
the Group’s subsidiaries because their vessels operate in international shipping markets in which
revenues and expenses are primarily settled in USD, and the Group’s most significant assets and
liabilities are paid for and settled in USD.

On March 6, 2020, the financial statements were authorized on behalf of GasLog’s board of
directors for issuance and filing.

The principal accounting policies are set out below.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of GasLog and entities
controlled by GasLog (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved where GasLog:

-  has power over the investee;

-  is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

-  has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date control is obtained and up to the date control ceases.
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

The other investors in subsidiaries in which the Group has less than 100% interest hold a
non-controlling interest in the net assets of these subsidiaries. Non-controlling interest is stated at the
non-controlling interest’s proportion of the net assets of the subsidiaries where the Group has less than
100% interest. Subsequent to initial recognition the carrying amount of non-controlling interest is
increased or decreased by the non-controlling interest’s share of subsequent changes in the equity of

**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

such subsidiaries. Total comprehensive income is attributed to a non-controlling interest even if this
results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.

Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing
control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the
Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative
interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests
are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and
attributed to owners of the Group.

**_Goodwill_**

Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognized as an asset at the date that control is
acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the
acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date
fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the
Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value
of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized
immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.

Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to
benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying
amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated
to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of
the profit or loss on disposal.

**_Investment in associates_**

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a
subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those
policies.

The results, assets and liabilities of associates are included in these financial statements using the
equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it
is accounted for under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. An
impairment assessment of investments in associates is performed when there is an indication that the
asset has been impaired or the impairment losses recognized in prior years no longer exist.

**For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019**
**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the investment is
reported at nil value and recognition of losses is discontinued except to the extent of the Group’s
commitment.

**_Investment in joint ventures_**

A joint arrangement is an arrangement where two or more parties have joint control. Joint control
is established by a contractual arrangement that requires unanimous agreement on decisions made on
relevant activities. Without the presence of joint control, joint arrangements do not exist.

Under IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint
operations or joint ventures. The classification depends on the contractual rights and obligations of
each investor, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. The arrangement is a joint
operation when the contractual agreement provides rights to assets and obligations for liabilities for
those parties sharing joint control. The joint arrangement is a joint venture when the agreement grants
rights to the arrangement’s net assets. The Cool Pool was a joint venture until June 2019 when a
termination agreement was entered between GasLog and the Cool Pool. Interests in joint ventures are
accounted for using the equity method (see Investment in associates above), after initially being
recognized at cost in the consolidated statement of financial position.

**_Leases_**

Lease income from operating leases of vessels where the Group is a lessor is recognized in profit
or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The respective leased assets are included in the
statement of financial position based on their nature under ‘‘Tangible fixed assets’’. The Group did not
need to make any adjustments to the accounting for assets held as lessor as a result of adopting the
new leasing standard.

The Group has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Group is the lessee. The new
policy and the impact of the change are discussed below.

Until December 31, 2018, leases of property, plant and equipment (i.e. vessels) where the Group,
as lessee, had substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership were classified as finance leases.
Finance leases were capitalized at the lease’s inception at the fair value of the leased property or, if
lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the
lease, if practicable, or else at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The corresponding rental
obligations, net of finance charges, were included in current and non-current liabilities as finance lease
liabilities. Each lease payment was allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost was
charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on
the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired
under finance leases was depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the asset’s useful
life and the lease term if there was no reasonable certainty that the Group would obtain ownership at
the end of the lease term. In addition, leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of
ownership were not transferred to the Group as lessee were classified as operating leases (i.e. vessels’
equipment, properties and other). Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives

received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the
lease.

From January 1, 2019 and onwards, each of the above leases is recognized as a right-of-use asset,
with a corresponding liability recognized at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the
Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured at the present value of the
minimum lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease, if practicable, or else at
the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges,
are included in current and non-current liabilities as lease liabilities. Each lease payment is allocated
between the liability and finance cost. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the
carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest rate method) and
by reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payment made. The right-of-use asset is depreciated
over its useful life or over the shorter of its useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable
certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term. Payments associated with
short-term leases and low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or
loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value items comprise of
low value vessel or office equipment.

**_Deferral and presentation of government grants_**

Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the profit or loss over the
period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate. Government
grants relating to income are included in non-current liabilities as deferred income and are credited to
profit or loss on a straight-line basis as costs are incurred over the duration of the specific project.

**_Accounting for (i) revenues and related operating expenses and (ii) voyage expenses and commissions_**

The Group’s revenues comprise revenues from time charters for the charter hire of its vessels,
gross pool revenues, management fees, project supervision income and other income earned during the
period in accordance with existing contracts.

A time charter represents a contract entered into for the use of a vessel for a specific period of
time and a specified daily charter hire rate. Following the exit from the Cool Pool, management
allocates revenues from time charters to two categories: (a) variable rate charters and (b) fixed rate
charters. The variable rate charter category contains vessels operating in the LNG carrier spot and
short-term market or those which have a variable rate of hire across the charter period. Time charter
revenue is recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant time charter
starting from the vessel’s delivery to the charterer. Except for the off-hire period, when a charter
agreement exists, the vessel is made available and services are provided to the charterer and collection
of the related revenue is reasonably assured. Unearned revenue includes cash received prior to the
balance sheet date relating to services to be rendered after the balance sheet date. Accrued revenue
represents income recognized in advance as a result of the straight-line revenue recognition in respect
of charter agreements that provide for varying charter rates.

Under a time charter arrangement, the hire rate per the charter agreement has two components:
the lease component and the service component relating to the vessel operating costs. The revenue in

**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

relation to the lease component of the agreements is accounted for under IFRS 16 Leases. The revenue
in relation to the service component relates to vessel operating expenses, which include expenses that
are paid by the vessel owner such as management fees, crew wages, provisions and stores, technical
maintenance and insurance expenses. These costs are essential to operating a charter and the
charterers receive the benefit of these when the vessel is used during the contracted time and,
therefore, these costs are accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue from
_Contracts with Customers._

Pool revenues were recognized on a gross basis representing time charter revenues earned by
GasLog vessels participating in the pool under charter agreements where GasLog contracts directly
with charterers. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis, when the vessel is made available and
services are provided to the charterer during the period, the amount can be estimated reliably and
collection of the related revenue is reasonably assured.

Revenue from vessel management and vessel construction project supervision contracts is
recognized when earned and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group
and such a benefit can be measured reliably.

Time charter hires received in advance are classified as liabilities until the criteria for recognizing
the revenue as earned are met.

Under a time charter arrangement, the vessel operating expenses such as management fees, crew
wages, provisions and stores, technical maintenance and insurance expenses and broker’s commissions
are paid by the vessel owner, whereas voyage expenses such as bunkers, port expenses, agents’ fees and
extra war risk insurance are paid by the charterer.

Management believes that mobilization of a vessel from a previous port of discharge to a
subsequent port of loading does not result in a separate benefit for charterers and that the activity is
thus incapable of being distinct. This activity is considered to be a required set-up activity to fulfill the
contract. Consequently, positioning and repositioning fees and associated expenses should be
recognized over the period of the contract to match the recognition of the respective hire revenues
realized, and not at a certain point in time following the adoption of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts
_with Customers. All other voyage expenses and vessel operating costs are expensed as incurred, with the_
exception of commissions, which are also recognized on a pro-rata basis over the duration of the period
of the time charter. Bunkers’ consumption included in voyage expenses represents mainly bunkers
consumed during vessels’ unemployment and off-hire.

**_Net pool allocation_**

In relation to the vessels’ participation in the Cool Pool (until July 2019), net pool allocation
represents GasLog’s share of the net revenues earned from the other pool participants’ vessels less the
other participants’ share of the net revenues earned by GasLog’s vessels included in the pool. Each
participant’s share of the net pool revenues is based on the number of pool points attributable to its
vessels and the number of days such vessels participated in the pool.

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

**_Financial income and costs_**

Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Dividend income is recognized when the right to
receive payment is established.

Interest expense, other borrowing costs and realized loss on cross currency swaps (‘‘CCSs’’) are
recognized on an accrual basis.

**_Foreign currencies_**

Transactions in currencies other than the USD are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing
at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in other currencies are retranslated into USD at the rates prevailing at that date. All
resulting exchange differences are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the
period in which they arise. The exchange differences from cash and bonds are classified in Financial
costs, while all other foreign exchange differences are classified in General and administrative expenses.

**_Deferred financing costs for undrawn facilities_**

Commitment, arrangement, structuring, legal and agency fees incurred for obtaining new loans or
refinancing existing facilities are recorded as deferred loan issuance costs and classified contra to debt,
while the fees incurred for the undrawn facilities are classified under non-current assets in the
statement of financial position and are reclassified contra to debt on the drawdown dates.

Deferred financing costs are deferred and amortized to financial costs over the term of the
relevant loan, using the effective interest method. When the relevant loan is terminated or
extinguished, the unamortized loan fees are written-off in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

**_Vessels under construction_**

Vessels under construction are presented at cost less identified impairment losses, if any. Costs
include shipyard installment payments and other vessel costs incurred during the construction period
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the vessels.

Upon completion of the construction, the vessels are presented on the statement of financial
position in accordance with the ‘‘Tangible fixed assets: Property, plant and equipment’’ policy as
described below.

**_Tangible fixed assets: Property, plant and equipment_**

Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment loss. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable
costs of bringing the asset to its working condition. The cost of an LNG vessel is split into two
components, a ‘‘vessel component’’ and a ‘‘dry-docking component’’. Depreciation for the vessel
component is calculated on a straight-line basis, after taking into account the estimated residual values,
over the estimated useful life of this major component of the vessels. Residual values are based on
management’s estimation about the amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal of its

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

vessels, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the vessels were already of the age and in the
condition expected at the end of their useful life.

The LNG vessels are required to undergo dry-docking overhaul every five years to restore their
service potential and to meet their classification requirements that cannot be performed while the
vessels are operating. The dry-docking component is estimated at the time of a vessel’s delivery from
the shipyard or acquisition from the previous owner and is measured based on the estimated cost of
the first dry-docking subsequent to its acquisition, based on the Group’s historical experience with
similar types of vessels. For subsequent dry-dockings, actual costs are capitalized when incurred. The
dry-docking component is depreciated over the period of five years in case of new vessels, and until the
next dry-docking for secondhand vessels (which is performed within five years from the vessel’s last
dry-docking).

Costs that will be capitalized as part of the future dry-dockings will include a variety of costs
incurred directly attributable to the dry-dock and costs incurred to meet classification and regulatory
requirements, as well as expenses related to the dock preparation and port expenses at the dry-dock
shipyard, dry-docking shipyard expenses, expenses related to hull, external surfaces and decks, and
expenses related to machinery and engines of the vessel, as well as expenses related to the testing and
correction of findings related to safety equipment on board. Dry-docking costs do not include vessel
operating expenses such as replacement parts, crew expenses, provisions, lubricants consumption,
insurance, management fees or management costs during the dry-docking period. Expenses related to
regular maintenance and repairs of vessels are expensed as incurred, even if such maintenance and
repair occurs during the same time period as dry-docking.

The expected useful lives of all long-lived assets are as follows:

**Vessel**

LNG vessel component . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35 years
Dry-docking component . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years
Furniture, computer, software and other office equipment . . 3 - 5 years
Leasehold improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 years (or remaining term of the lease)

Management estimates the useful life of its vessels to be 35 years from the date of initial delivery
from the shipyard. Secondhand vessels are depreciated from the date of their acquisition through their
remaining estimated useful life.

The useful lives of all assets and the depreciation method are reviewed annually to ensure that the
method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from
items of property, plant and equipment. The residual value is also reviewed at each financial
period-end. If expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for prospectively
in profit or loss in the period of the change and future periods.

Management estimates residual value of its vessels to be equal to the product of its lightweight
tonnage (‘‘LWT’’) and an estimated scrap rate per LWT. Effective December 31, 2019, following
management’s annual reassessment, the estimated scrap rate per LWT was decreased. This change in
estimate is expected to increase the future annual depreciation by $644. The estimated residual value of

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

the vessels may not represent the fair market value at any time partly because market prices of scrap
values tend to fluctuate. The Partnership might revise the estimate of the residual values of the vessels
in the future in response to changing market conditions.

Ordinary maintenance and repairs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as
incurred.

When assets are sold, they are derecognized and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is
included in profit or loss.

**_Impairment of tangible fixed assets, vessels under construction and vessel held under finance lease renamed to_**
**_right-of-use assets_**

All assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Whenever the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of
profit or loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and
‘‘value in use’’. The fair value less cost of disposal is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in
an arm’s length transaction less the costs of disposal, while ‘‘value in use’’ is the present value of
estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal
at the end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if it is not
possible, for the cash-generating unit. Each vessel is considered to be a separate cash-generating unit.
The fair values of the vessels are estimated from market-based evidence by appraisal that is normally
undertaken by professionally qualified brokers.

**_Reimbursable capital expenditures_**

Costs eligible for capitalization that are contractually reimbursable by our charterers are
recognized on a gross basis in the period incurred under ‘‘Vessels’’. Concurrently, an equal amount is
deferred as a liability and amortized to profit or loss as income over the remaining tenure of the
charter party agreement.

**_Provisions_**

Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized as a provision is
the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the
reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a
provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying
amount is the present value of those cash flows. When some or all of the economic benefits required to
settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset
if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be
measured reliably.

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

**_Inventories_**

Inventories represent lubricants on board the vessel and, in the event of a vessel not being
employed under a charter, the bunkers on board the vessel. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
calculated on a first in, first out basis, and net realizable value.

**_Financial instruments_**

Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument. All financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value. Transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities
(other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or
deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial
recognition.

-  Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions
and other short-term, highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts
of cash with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase that are subject to
an insignificant risk of change in value.

-  Restricted cash

Restricted cash comprises cash held that is not available for use by the Group including cash held
in blocked accounts in order to comply with the covenants under the Group’s credit facilities.

-  Short-term investments

Short-term investments represent short-term, highly liquid time deposits placed with financial
institutions which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash with original maturities of
more than three months but less than 12 months at the time of purchase that are subject to an
insignificant risk of change in value.

-  Trade receivables

Trade receivables are carried at the amount expected to be received from the third party to settle
the obligation. At each reporting date, all potentially uncollectible accounts are assessed
individually for purposes of determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts. Trade
receivables are recognized initially at their transaction price and subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest method. Trade receivables are written off when there is
no reasonable expectation of recovery. See Note 9 for further information about the Group’s
accounting for trade receivables.

The simplified approach is applied to trade and other receivables and the Group recognizes
lifetime expected credit losses (‘‘ECLs’’) on trade receivables. Under the simplified approach, the
loss allowance is always equal to ECLs.

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

-  Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value (net of transaction costs). Borrowings are
subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Any difference
between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement of the borrowings is recognized
in the statement of profit or loss over the term of the borrowings.

-  Derivative financial instruments

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge its
exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including interest rate swaps, CCSs and
forward foreign exchange contracts.

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date the derivative
contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting
date. The resulting changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or
loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which
event the timing of the recognition in the consolidated statement of profit or loss depends on the
nature of the hedge relationship. Derivatives are presented as assets when their valuation is
favorable to the Group and as liabilities when unfavorable to the Group.

The Group’s criteria for classifying a derivative instrument in a hedging relationship include:
(1) the existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument
(i.e., the hedging instrument and hedged item must, based on an economic rationale, be expected
to move in opposite directions as a result of a change in the hedged risk); (2) the effect of the
credit risk should not dominate the value changes of either the hedged item or the hedging
instrument (i.e., credit risk can arise on both the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
form of the counterparty’s credit risk or the entity’s own credit risk); and (3) the hedge ratio
(i.e., the ratio between the amount of hedged item and the amount of hedging instrument) of the
hedging relationship is the same as that actually used in the economic hedge.

At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between
hedging instruments and hedged items, including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging
instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group
documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

_Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting_

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as
cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are
reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item
affects profit or loss, in the same line item as the recognized hedged item. Hedge accounting is
discontinued when the Group terminates the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

Any gain or loss accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized in the
consolidated statement of profit or loss when the hedged item affects the consolidated statement
of profit or loss. When a forecast transaction designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge
is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recycled immediately to
the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

_Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting_

Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of
any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in
the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

-  Lease liabilities

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the
present value of the minimum lease payments—discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease,
if practicable, or else at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate—and subsequently measured at
amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Finance charges in respect of finance
leases are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under ‘‘Financial costs’’.

**_Segment information_**

The information provided to the Group’s chief operating decision maker, being the Chief
Executive Officer, to review the Group’s operating results and allocate resources is on a consolidated
basis for a single reportable segment. Furthermore, when the Group charters a vessel to a charterer,
the charterer is free to trade the vessel worldwide and, as a result, the disclosure of geographic
information is impracticable.

**_Share-based compensation_**

Share-based compensation to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the
fair value of the equity instruments on the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair
value of share-based transactions are set out in Note 22.

The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based compensation is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity
instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each
reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement
of profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding
adjustment to the share-based compensation reserve.

**_Termination benefits_**

Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal
retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The Group recognizes termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the Group
can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the Group recognizes costs for a
restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
and involves the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary
redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to
accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are
discounted to present value.

**_Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s
management evaluates whether estimates should be made on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical
experience, consultation with experts and other methods management considers reasonable in the
particular circumstances. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in
outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets or liabilities in
the future. Critical accounting judgments are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties
and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.

**_Critical accounting judgments_**

In the process of applying GasLog’s accounting policies, management has made the following
judgments, apart from those involving estimations, that had the most significant effect on the amounts
recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

**_Classification of the non-controlling interests:_** The non-controlling interests in the Partnership
comprise the portion of the Partnership’s common units that are not directly or indirectly held by
GasLog (32,483,580 units as of December 31, 2019). Under the terms of the partnership agreement, the
Partnership is required to distribute 100% of available cash (as defined in the partnership agreement)
with respect to each quarter within 45 days of the end of the quarter to the partners. Available cash
can be summarized as cash and cash equivalents less an amount equal to cash reserves established by
the Partnership’s board of directors to (i) provide for the proper conduct of the business of the
Partnership (including reserves for future capital expenditures and for anticipated future credit needs of
the Partnership) subsequent to such quarter, (ii) comply with applicable law or any loan agreement,
security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which any
Partnership member is a party or by which it is bound or its assets are subject and/or (iii) provide funds
for certain distributions relating to future periods.

In reaching a judgment as to whether the non-controlling interests in the Partnership should be
classified as liabilities or equity interests, management has considered the wide discretion of the board
of directors of the Partnership to determine whether any portion of the amount of cash available to the
Partnership constitutes available cash and that it is possible that there could be no available cash. In
the event that there is no available cash, as determined by the Partnership’s board of directors, the
Partnership does not have a contractual obligation to make a distribution. Accordingly, management

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

has concluded that the non-controlling interests do not represent a contractual obligation on the
Partnership to deliver cash and therefore should be classified as equity within the financial statements.

**Key sources of estimation uncertainty are as follows:**

**_Impairment of vessels:_** The Group evaluates the carrying amounts of each of its vessels to
determine whether there is any indication that those vessels have suffered an impairment loss by
considering both internal and external sources of information. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of vessels is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if
any. The total carrying amount of the Group’s vessels as of December 31, 2019, was $4,407,156
(December 31, 2018: $4,304,252).

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The Group’s
estimates of recoverable value assume that the vessels are all in seaworthy condition without need for
repair and certified in class without notations of any kind. In assessing the fair value less cost to sell of
the vessel, the Group obtains charter free market values for each vessel from independent and
internationally recognized ship brokers on a semi-annual basis, which are also commonly used and
accepted by the Group’s lenders for determining compliance with the relevant covenants in its credit
facilities. Vessel values can be highly volatile, so the charter-free market values may not be indicative of
the current or future market value of the Group’s vessels or prices that could be achieved if it were to
sell them. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. The
projection of cash flows related to vessels is complex and requires management to make various
estimates including future charter rates, vessel operating expenses and the discount rate.

As of December 31, 2019, the carrying amounts of each of the six steam turbine propulsion
(‘‘Steam’’) vessels (the Methane Rita Andrea, the Methane Jane Elizabeth, the Methane Lydon Volney, the
_Methane Alison Victoria, the Methane Shirley Elisabeth and the Methane Heather Sally), of eight tri-fuel_
diesel electric (‘‘TFDE’’) vessels (the GasLog Savannah, the GasLog Singapore, the GasLog Seattle, the
_Solaris, the GasLog Saratoga, the_ _GasLog Salem, the Methane Julia Louise and the Methane Becki Anne)_
and three low pressure dual fuel two-stroke propulsion (‘‘X-DF’’) vessels (the GasLog Genoa, the
_GasLog Gladstone and the_ _GasLog Hong Kong) were higher than the charter free market values_
estimated by ship brokers. The Group concluded that this, together with certain other events and
circumstances (as further described in Note 6) indicated the existence of potential impairment of these
vessels. As a result, the Group performed an impairment assessment for these vessels by comparing
their values in use, being the discounted projected net operating cash flows for these vessels to their
carrying values. The assumptions that the Group used in its discounted projected net operating cash
flow analysis included, among others, utilization, operating revenues, voyage expenses and commissions,
dry-docking costs, operating expenses (including management costs), residual values and the discount
rate. The key assumptions, being those to which the outcome of the impairment assessment is most
sensitive, are the estimate of charter rates for non-contracted revenue days and the discount rate.

**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

Revenue assumptions were based on contracted time charters up to the end of the current contract
for each vessel, as well as the estimated average time charter rates for the remaining life of the vessel
after the completion of its current contract. The revenue assumptions exclude days of scheduled
off-hire based on the fleet’s historical performance and internal forecasts. The estimated daily time
charter rates used for non-contracted revenue days after the completion of the current time charter are
based on a combination of (i) recent charter market rates, (ii) conditions existing in the LNG market
as of December 31, 2019, (iii) historical average time charter rates, based on publications by
independent third party maritime research services (‘‘maritime research publications’’), (iv) estimated
future time charter rates, based on maritime research publications that provide such forecasts and
(v) management’s internal assessment of long-term charter rates achievable by each class of vessel.

More specifically, for vessels whose charters have expired or will expire within 2020, the estimated
charter rates and utilization for the first year from the reporting date were based on the approved
annual budget for the year, which was formed based on the anticipated market conditions for 2020 and
the latest available maritime research publications from ship brokers for short-term (less than
12 months) employment of a vessel operating in the spot market on less than 1-year time charter
contracts.

For non-contracted periods starting on January 1, 2021 for already expired charters or upon the
expiration of the firm charter period of a vessel within 2021 and up to December 31, 2024, the Group
used the most recent charter market rates for a 5-year time charter rate based on available data from
maritime research publications which is $45 per day for Steam vessels and $65 per day for TFDE
vessels. Such rates are lower than prevailing spot rates as of December 31, 2019.

For the remaining period from January 1, 2025 through the end of each vessel’s useful life (for
non-contracted periods), the estimated average time charter rates for Steam, TFDE and X-DF vessels
were based on analysis of future supply and demand for LNG, analysis of future LNG shipping supply
and demand balances, internally estimated and market-derived costs of building and financing newbuild
LNG vessels, the technical characteristics of each vessel and an assessment of the appropriate discount
for Steam and TFDE vessels compared to modern newbuild LNG carriers, which is driven largely by
unit freight cost differentials and utilization of such vessels.

Recognizing that the LNG industry is cyclical and subject to significant volatility based on factors
beyond the Group’s control, management believes that the use of the revenue estimates discussed
above to be reasonable as of the reporting date. The Group has assumed no inflation nor any other
revenue escalation or growth factors in determining forecasted time charter rates beyond the contracted
charter period through the end of a vessel’s useful life, consistent with long-run historical evidence.

The Group used an annual operating expenses escalation factor equal to 1% based on its historical
data and experience, as well as expectations of future inflation and operating and dry-docking costs.
Estimates for the remaining useful lives of the current fleet and residual and scrap values are the same
as those used for the Group’s depreciation policy. All estimates used and assumptions made were in
accordance with the Group’s internal budgets and historical experience of the shipping industry.

In the Group’s impairment assessment, the rate used to discount future estimated cash flows to
their present values was approximately 6.5% to 7.25% as of December 31, 2019 (7.0% to 7.5% as of

December 31, 2018). This was based on an estimated weighted average cost of capital calculated using
cost of equity and cost of debt components, adjusted also for vessel-specific risks and uncertainties.

The values in use for the six Steam vessels calculated as per above were lower than the carrying
amounts of those vessels and, consequently, an impairment loss of $162,149 was recognized in the year
ended December 31, 2019 (Note 6). The values in use for each of the TFDE and X-DF vessels with
indicators of impairment were greater than their respective carrying amounts, and therefore no
impairment loss was recognized for these vessels.

In connection with the impairment testing of our vessels as of December 31, 2019, we performed a
sensitivity analysis on the most difficult, subjective or complex assumptions that have the potential to
affect the outcome of the impairment assessment, which are the projected charter hire rates used to
forecast future cash flows for non-contracted revenue days and the discount rate used, in particular for
the Steam vessels (Note 6). It is reasonably possible that changes to these assumptions within the next
financial year could require a material adjustment of the carrying amount of the Group’s Steam vessels.

**_Adoption of new and revised IFRS_**

**(a) Standards and interpretations adopted in the current period**

In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 Leases, which sets out the principles for the recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer
(‘‘lessee’’) and the supplier (‘‘lessor’’). IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases by lessees as
either operating leases or finance leases and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model.
Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a
term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) depreciation of lease
assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the statement of profit or loss. Lessors continue to
classify their leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases
differently. IFRS 16 Leases supersedes the previous leases Standard, IAS 17 Leases, and related
Interpretations. The standard is effective from January 1, 2019.

The Group is a lessee under a vessel sale and leaseback arrangement and also leases various
properties, vessel and office equipment. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods but may
have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of
different terms and conditions. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, leases are recognized as a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use
by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost
is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the
shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease
liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: (a) fixed payments (including
in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable, (b) variable lease payments that are
based on an index or a rate (if any), (c) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual
value guarantees (if any), (d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain

to exercise that option, and (e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term
reflects the lessee exercising that option. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: (a) the amount of the initial
measurement of lease liability, (b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less
any lease incentives received, (c) any initial direct costs, and (d) restoration costs. Payments associated
with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an
expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value
assets comprise vessel and office equipment.

For leases where the Group is the lessee, the Group has elected to apply the simplified approach,
by which comparative information is not restated and any adjustment is recognized at the date of initial
application of IFRS 16 Leases. In addition, the Group has elected to apply the exemption for
short-term leases or leases of low-value assets where available. The adoption of the standard on
January 1, 2019, resulted in an increase in total assets of $7,618, an increase in retained earnings of
$215, an increase in non-controlling interests of $128 and an increase in total liabilities of $7,275.

In September 2019, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39
_Financial Instrument: Recognition and measurement, and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which_
provide certain reliefs in connection with interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments will be
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020. The Group has elected to adopt the
amendments early. In accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted
retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed at the start of the reporting period or were
designated thereafter. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge
accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by interbank offered rate (‘‘IBOR’’)
reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to
terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness should continue to be recorded in the income statement.
Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which include the
uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present. The Group uses CCSs

in order to hedge the Group’s exposure to fluctuations deriving from its bonds (Note 26). The
amendments permit continuation of hedge accounting even though there is uncertainty about the
replacement of the floating interest rates included in its CCSs (Note 24).

At the date of authorization of these consolidated financial statements, there were no IFRS
standards and amendments issued but not yet adopted with an expected material effect on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements.

**3. Goodwill**

Goodwill resulted from the acquisition in 2005 of Ceres LNG Services Ltd., the vessel
management company, which represents a cash-generating unit. On September 30, 2011, Ceres LNG
Services Ltd. was renamed ‘‘GasLog LNG Services Ltd’’. As of December 31, 2019, the Group assessed
the recoverable amount of goodwill and concluded that goodwill associated with the Group’s vessel
management company was not impaired. The recoverable amount of the vessel management operations
is determined based on discounted future cash flows based on the financial budget approved by
management for the year-ending December 31, 2020 and management forecasts until 2023.

The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations (2020 and beyond) are as follows:

(i) Average inflation of 1.0% per annum based on historical data and performance;

(ii) A pre-tax discount rate of 8.0% per annum based on cost of equity;

(iii) Annual growth rate of 1.0%; and

(iv) 1 Euro = USD 1.135 based on the 2020 budget.

Growth is based on the number of vessels expected to be under management based on the
shipbuilding contracts in place at the end of the year and the long-term strategy of the Group.
Management believes that any reasonably possible further change in the key assumptions on which
recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to exceed
its recoverable amount.

**_GasLog Partners’ offerings_**

On January 27, 2017, GasLog Partners completed an equity offering of 3,750,000 common units at
a public offering price of $20.50 per unit. In addition, the option to purchase additional units was
partially exercised by the underwriter on February 24, 2017, resulting in 120,000 additional units being
sold at the same price. The aggregate net proceeds from this offering, including the partial exercise by
the underwriter of the option to purchase additional units, after deducting underwriting discounts and
other offering expenses were $78,197.

On May 15, 2017, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 5,750,000 8.625% Series A
Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate Preference Units (the ‘‘Partnership’s

underwriters of their option to purchase additional Partnership’s Series A Preference Units), liquidation
preference $25.00 per unit, at a price to the public of $25.00 per preference unit. The net proceeds
from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses were
$138,804. The Partnership’s Series A Preference Units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol ‘‘GLOP PR A’’. The initial distribution on the Partnership’s Series A Preference
Units was paid on September 15, 2017.

On May 16, 2017, GasLog Partners commenced an ‘‘at-the-market’’ common equity offering
programme (‘‘ATM Programme’’), under which the Partnership may, from time to time, raise equity
through the issuance and sale of new common units having an aggregate offering value of up to
$100,000 in accordance with the terms of an equity distribution agreement, entered into on the same
date. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC have agreed to act as sales agents. On
November 3, 2017, the Partnership entered into the Amended and Restated Equity Distribution
Agreement to increase the size of the ATM Programme to $144,040 and to include UBS
Securities LLC as a sales agent.

From establishment of the ATM Programme through December 31, 2017, GasLog Partners had
issued and received payment for 2,737,405 common units at a weighted average price of $22.97 per
common unit for total net proceeds, after deducting fees and other expenses, of $61,225.

Additionally, on May 16, 2017, the subordination period on the subordinated units of GasLog
Partners held by GasLog expired and consequently all 9,822,358 subordinated units of GasLog Partners
converted into common units of GasLog Partners on a one-for-one basis and now participate pro rata
with all other outstanding common units in distributions of available cash.

On January 17, 2018, GasLog Partners completed a public offering of 4,600,000 8.200% Series B
Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate Preference Units (the ‘‘Partnership’s Series B
Preference Units’’), including 600,000 units issued upon the exercise in full by the underwriters of their
option to purchase additional Partnership’s Series B Preference Units, at a price to the public of $25.00
per preference unit. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and other offering expenses, were $111,194. The Partnership’s Series B Preference Units
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘‘GLOP PR B’’.

On April 3, 2018, GasLog Partners issued 33,998 common units in connection with the vesting of
16,999 Restricted Common Units (‘‘RCUs’’) and 16,999 Performance Common Units (‘‘PCUs’’) under
its 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘‘GasLog Partners’ Plan’’) at a price of $23.55 per unit.
Subsequently, on April 26, 2018, in connection with the acquisition of GAS-fourteen Ltd., the entity
that owns and charters the _GasLog Gibraltar, GasLog Partners issued 1,858,975 common units to_
GasLog at a price of $24.21 per unit. On November 15, 2018, GasLog Partners completed a public
offering of 4,000,000 8.500% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Fixed to Floating Rate
Preference Units (the ‘‘Partnership’s Series C Preference Units’’), at a price to the public of $25.00 per
preference unit. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts,
commissions and other offering expenses, were $96,307. The Partnership’s Series C Preference Units
are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘‘GLOP PR C’’.

On November 27, 2018, the Partnership Agreement was amended to allow for the substitution of
the existing incentive distribution rights (the ‘‘Old IDRs’’) with a new class of incentive distribution
rights (the ‘‘New IDRs’’, together with the Old IDRs, the ‘‘IDRs’’) with revised rights to distributions.
Pursuant to this amendment, the 48.0% tier of the New IDRs holders was removed, while the
definition of the available cash from operating surplus for distribution to the New IDRs holders was
revised to exclude any available cash from operating surplus generated from third-party
(i.e., non-GasLog) acquisitions, as defined in the agreement. In exchange for the waiving of the
aforementioned rights, the Partnership paid $25,000 to GasLog, holder of the Old IDRs.

The following table illustrates the percentage allocation of the additional available cash from
operating surplus after the payment of preference unit distributions, in respect to such rights, until
November 27, 2018:

Effective November 27, 2018, the percentage allocation of the additional available cash from
operating surplus after the payment of preference unit distributions and excluding available cash from
operating surplus derived from non-GasLog acquisitions was amended, in respect to such rights, as

Under the Partnership’s ATM Programme, in the year ended December 31, 2018, GasLog Partners
has issued and received payment for 2,553,899 common units at a weighted average price of $23.72 per
common unit for total net proceeds, after deducting fees and other expenses, of $60,013.

On January 29, 2019, the board of directors of GasLog Partners authorized a unit repurchase
programme of up to $25,000 covering the period January 31, 2019 to December 31, 2021. Under the
terms of the repurchase programme, GasLog Partners may repurchase common units from time to
time, at its discretion, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During the year
ended December 31, 2019, GasLog Partners repurchased and cancelled 1,171,572 common units at a
weighted average price of $19.52 per common unit, for a total cost of $22,890 including commissions.

**4. Equity Transactions (Continued)**

On February 26, 2019, the Partnership entered into a Third Amended and Restated Equity
Distribution Agreement to further increase the size of the ATM Programme from $144,040 to $250,000.
As of December 31, 2019, the unutilized portion of the ATM Programme is $126,556.

On April 1, 2019, GasLog Partners issued 49,850 common units in connection with the vesting of
24,925 RCUs and 24,925 PCUs under the GasLog Partners’ Plan at a price of $22.99 per unit.

On June 24, 2019, the Partnership Agreement was amended, effective June 30, 2019, to eliminate
the IDRs in exchange for the issuance by the Partnership to GasLog of 2,532,911 common units and
2,490,000 Class B units (of which 415,000 are Class B-1 units, 415,000 are Class B-2 units, 415,000 are
Class B-3 units, 415,000 are Class B-4 units, 415,000 are Class B-5 units and 415,000 are Class B-6
units), issued on June 30, 2019. The Class B units have all of the rights and obligations attached to the
common units, except for voting rights and participation in distributions until such time as GasLog
exercises its right to convert the Class B units to common units. The Class B units will become eligible
for conversion on a one-for-one basis into common units at GasLog’s option on July 1, 2020, July 1,
2021, July 1, 2022, July 1, 2023, July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025 for the Class B-1 units, Class B-2 units,
Class B-3 units, Class B-4 units, Class B-5 units and the Class B-6 units, respectively. Following the
IDR elimination, the allocation of GasLog Partners’ profit to the non-controlling interests is based on
the revised distribution policy for available cash stated in the Partnership Agreement as amended,
effective June 30, 2019, and under which 98% of the available cash is distributed to the common
unitholders and 2% is distributed to the general partner. The updated earnings allocation applies to the
total GasLog Partners’ profit for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and onwards.

Dividends declared attributable to non-controlling interests included in the consolidated statement
of changes in equity represent cash distributions to holders of common and preference units.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, the board of directors of the Partnership approved and
declared cash distributions of $73,090 and of $31,036 for the common units and preference units,
respectively, held by non-controlling interests.

Vessels under construction represent scheduled advance payments to the shipyards as well as
certain capitalized expenditures. As of December 31, 2019, the Group has paid to the shipyard
$197,637 for the vessels that are under construction and expects to pay the remaining installments as
they come due upon each vessel’s keel laying, launching and delivery (Note 23(a)).

The vessels under construction costs as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 are comprised of:

**As of**

**7. Leases**

On adoption of IFRS 16, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases of various
properties, vessel communication equipment and certain printers which had previously been classified
as operating leases under IAS 17 Leases. As of January 1, 2019, these liabilities were measured at the
present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using a weighted average incremental
borrowing rate of 4.8%.

Ship management client accounts represent amounts provided by the clients of GasLog LNG
Services Ltd. in order to enable the Group to cover obligations of vessels under management. A
compensating balance is held as a current liability.

**9. Trade and Other Receivables**

Trade and other receivables consist of the following:

**As of**

Trade receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 808 9,463

Trade and other receivables are amounts due from third parties for services performed in the
ordinary course of business. They are generally due for settlement immediately and therefore are all
classified as current. Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at the amount of consideration
that is unconditional unless they contain certain significant financing components, at which point they
are recognized at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the
contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortized cost using the effective
interest rate method.

Accrued income represents net revenues receivable from charterers, which have not yet been
invoiced; all other amounts not yet invoiced are included under Other receivables.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2019 no allowance for expected credit losses was recorded.

GAS-eighteen Ltd., GAS-nineteen Ltd., GAS-twenty Ltd., GAS-twenty one Ltd. and GAS-twenty
seven Ltd.. The balance of $68,800 was paid from available cash. Following the decrease in the
aggregate available amount by $1,300, the senior tranche facility provides for four advances of $72,288
each and a fifth advance of $106,298. The first four advances shall be repaid in 20 quarterly equal
installments commencing three months after the relevant drawdown dates while the fifth advance shall
be repaid in 17 quarterly equal installments commencing 12 months after the relevant drawdown date,

$20,042 applies to Advance D (GAS-twenty one Ltd.) and $59,918 applies to Advance E (GAS-twenty
seven Ltd.). The prepayment did not result in substantially different terms and was accounted for as a
debt modification. Consequently, the unamortized loan fees of $1,016 were amortized based on the
revised effective interest rate over the remaining life of each Advance.

On January 5, 2018, GasLog Partners prepaid the remaining $29,750 under the junior tranche
facility agreement, which was subsequently cancelled. The prepayment was applied to the advances as
follows: $9,917 applies to Advance B (GAS-nineteen Ltd.), $9,917 applies to Advance C (GAS-twenty

accelerated amortization as of December 31, 2017 of $213.

(December 31, 2018: $321,439). Amounts drawn bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin. The five vesselowning entities that made the drawdowns are also required to maintain at all times minimum liquidity

Carriers Ltd.. The facilities include customary respective covenants, and among other restrictions the
facilities include a fair market value covenant pursuant to which the majority lenders may request
additional security under the facilities if the aggregate fair market value of the collateral vessels
(without taking into account any charter arrangements) were to fall below 120% of the aggregate
outstanding principal balance (with respect to each individual vessel in the debt financing agreement
entered into in October 2015 and the 7xNB Facility, below 115% of the outstanding principal balance
of that vessel for the first two years after each drawdown and below 120% at any time thereafter). The
Group was in compliance with the required minimum security coverage as of December 31, 2019.

**_Bonds_**

On June 27, 2013, GasLog issued NOK 500,000 (or $83,206 based on the exchange rate on
June 27, 2013) of senior unsecured bonds maturing on June 27, 2018 (the ‘‘NOK 2018 Bonds’’). On
May 2, 2014, GasLog closed a follow-on issue of NOK 500,000 (or $83,612 based on the exchange rate
on closing date) of the NOK 2018 Bonds at a premium of $4,180 (based on the exchange rate on
closing date). On June 27, 2016, GasLog repurchased and cancelled NOK 588,000 (or $70,677) of the
outstanding NOK 2018 Bonds at a price of 103.0% of par value, resulting in a loss of $2,120. On
June 27, 2017, GasLog completed the repurchase of the outstanding balance of the NOK 2018 Bonds
at a price of 103.0% of par value, resulting in a loss of $1,459, for a total consideration of NOK
424,360 ($70,783 at the swapped rate under the associated CCSs). The aforementioned repurchase was
considered an extinguishment of the existing NOK 2018 Bonds, and as a result, the unamortized bond
fees and premium of $283 (gain) were written off to profit or loss for the year ended December 31,
2017.

On June 27, 2016, GasLog also completed the issuance of NOK 750,000 (equivalent to $90,150) of
new senior unsecured bonds (the ‘‘NOK 2021 Bonds’’) in the Norwegian bond market. The NOK 2021
Bonds were due to mature in May 2021 and have a coupon of 6.9% over three-month Norwegian
Interbank Offered Rate (‘‘NIBOR’’). On November 27, 2019, GasLog repurchased and cancelled NOK
316,000 of the outstanding NOK 2021 Bonds at a price of 104.75% of par value, resulting in a loss of
$1,644.

The NOK 2021 Bonds bear interest at NIBOR plus margin. Interest payments are made in arrears
on a quarterly basis. GasLog may redeem the NOK 2021 Bonds in whole or in part as follows: (a) with
settlement date at any time from June 27, 2019 to but not including June 27, 2020 at 104.0% of par
plus accrued interest on redeemed amount, (b) with settlement date at any time from June 27, 2020 to
but not including December 27, 2020 at 102.50% of par plus accrued interest on redeemed amount,
and (c) with settlement date at any time from December 27, 2020 to but not including the maturity
date at 101.0% of par plus accrued interests on redeemed amount. Subsequently, on January 31, 2020,
GasLog repurchased and cancelled the outstanding NOK 2021 Bonds, at a price of 104% of par value.

On March 22, 2017, GasLog closed a public offering of $250,000 aggregate principal amount of
8.875% senior unsecured notes due in 2022 (the ‘‘8.875% Senior Notes’’) at a public offering price of
100% of the principal amount. On May 16, 2019, GasLog closed a follow-on issue of $75,000 aggregate
principal amount of the 8.875% Senior Notes priced at 102.5% of par with a yield to maturity of
7.89%. The gross proceeds from this offering were $76,875, including a $1,875 premium. The carrying

December 31, 2019, was $322,938 (December 31, 2018: $246,760). In addition, GasLog paid $10,000 for
the partial exchange of the outstanding 8.875% Senior Notes at a price of 104.75% of par value,
resulting in a loss of $475. The exchange was completed in January 2020.

Interest payment on the 8.875% Senior Notes is made in arrears on a quarterly basis. GasLog may
redeem the 8.875% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at a
redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of such notes and (b) the
sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon
(exclusive of interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption), computed using a discount rate
equal to the applicable treasury rate plus 50 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to
the date of redemption.

On November 27, 2019, GasLog completed the issuance of NOK 900,000 (equivalent to $98,550)
of new senior unsecured bonds (the ‘‘NOK 2024 Bonds’’) in the Norwegian bond market. The NOK
2024 Bonds will mature in November 2024 and bear interest at NIBOR plus margin. Interest payments
shall be made in arrears on a quarterly basis. GasLog may redeem the aforementioned bond in whole
or in part as from May 2024 at 101% of par plus accrued interests on the redeemed amount.

The carrying amount under the NOK 2021 Bonds and the NOK 2024 Bonds, net of unamortized
financing costs and unamortized premium, as of December 31, 2019 was $149,433 (carrying amount
under the NOK 2021 Bonds as of December 31, 2018: $85,231) while their fair value was $157,383
based on a USD/NOK exchange rate of 0.1134 as of December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: $91,664,
based on a USD/NOK exchange rate of 0.1149).

year $1.10/share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GasLog may make any amount of Distributions, so
long as the Group’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed $150,000, provided
that GasLog can demonstrate, by delivering a compliance certificate to the bond trustee, that no event
of default is continuing or would result from such Distributions.

above. Also, under the NOK 2021 Bonds GasLog is permitted to make Distributions up to a maximum

Compliance with the loan financial covenants is required on a semi-annual basis while compliance
with the NOK 2021 Bonds, the NOK 2024 Bonds and the 8.875% Senior Notes covenants is required
at all times. The Group was in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2019.

**_Debt Repayment Schedule_**

The maturity table below reflects the principal repayments of the loans, the NOK 2021 Bonds, the
NOK 2024 Bonds and the 8.875% Senior Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2019 based on the
repayment schedule of the respective loan facilities (as described above):

**As of**
**December 31, 2019**

Not later than one year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 268,090
Later than one year and not later than three years . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,557,232
Later than three years and not later than five years . . . . . . . . . . . . 638,491
Later than five years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 734,498

**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **3,198,311**

268,090
1,557,232
638,491
734,498

**3,198,311**


The weighted average interest rate for the outstanding loan facilities for the year ended
December 31, 2019 was 5.05% (December 31, 2018: 4.84%) excluding the fixed interest rate for the
interest rate swaps where hedge accounting is not applicable (Note 26).

After excluding the unamortized deferred loan issuance costs the carrying amount of the Group’s
bank debt recognized in the consolidated financial statements approximates its fair value since the debt
bears interest at a variable interest rate.

- The exercise prices were decreased by $0.40 and/or $0.38 to reflect the effect from the distribution of the special
dividends declared on November 28, 2018 and December 14, 2019, respectively.

In accordance with the terms of the Plan, there are only service condition requirements. The
awards will be settled in cash or in shares at the sole discretion of the compensation committee of the
board of directors. These awards have been treated as equity settled because the Group has no present
obligation to settle in cash. The amount to be settled for each SAR exercised is computed in each case,
as the excess, if any, of the fair market value (the closing price of shares) on the exercise date over the
exercise price of the SAR.

The fair value of the SARs has been calculated based on the Modified Black-Scholes-Merton
method. Expected volatility was based on historical share price volatility for the period since the
Group’s initial public offering. The expected dividend is based on management’s expectations of future
payments on the grant date. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the SARs

**23. Commitments (Continued)**

-  In March 2019, GAS-thirty one Ltd., signed an agreement with the principal LNG shipping
entity of JERA Co., Inc (‘‘JERA’’), for its newbuilding Hull No. 2274 to be chartered to JERA
upon delivery in 2020 for an initial term of 12 years.

(c) Related to the acquisition of six vessels from a subsidiary of BG Group plc in 2014 and
another two vessels in 2015, the Group is committed to purchase depot spares from MSL with an
aggregate value of $8,000 of which depot spares with value of $660 have been purchased and paid as of
December 31, 2019 and are included in Tangible fixed assets (Note 6). The remaining spares are
expected to be acquired before March 31, 2020.

(d) On October 11, 2016, GasLog LNG Services Ltd. entered into an arrangement whereby it has
access to all long lead items (‘‘LLIs’’) necessary for the conversion of a GasLog LNG carrier vessel into
an FSRU whereby such conversion work would be undertaken by Keppel Shipyard Limited (‘‘Keppel’’).
GasLog is only obligated to pay for such LLIs if utilized for a GasLog vessel conversion, or, if the LLIs
have not been utilized in a GasLog vessel conversion within three years from November 2016, the items
may be put to GasLog at 85% of the original cost, or GasLog may call for the purchase of such LLIs
at 115% of the original cost. Following the expiration of the arrangement, GasLog has agreed to pay
$17,625 for the acquisition of these LLIs in February 2020 (Note 30).

(e) In September 2017 (and in addition to the seven existing maintenance agreements signed in
2015 in relation to GasLog vessels), GasLog LNG Services Ltd. entered into further maintenance
agreements with Wartsila Greece S.A. (‘‘Wartsila’’) in respect of eight additional GasLog LNG carriers.
In July 2018, GasLog LNG Services Ltd. renewed the maintenance agreements signed in 2015 with
Wartsila. The agreements ensure dynamic maintenance planning, technical support, security of spare
parts supply, specialist technical personnel and performance monitoring.

(f) In March 2019, GasLog LNG Services entered into an agreement with Samsung in respect of
twenty of GasLog’s vessels. The agreement covers the supply of ballast water management systems on
board the vessels by Samsung and associated field, commissioning and engineering services for a firm
period of six years.

(g) Other Guarantees:

As of December 31, 2019, GasLog LNG Services Ltd. has provided bank guarantees as follows:

-  Up to $250 to third parties relating to the satisfactory performance of its ship management
activities;

-  Bank guarantee of $10 to the Greek Ministry of Finance relating to the satisfactory performance
of the obligations arising under Greek laws 89/1967, 378/1968 as amended by law 814/1978.

**24. Financial Risk Management**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, liquidity risk
and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of
financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to moderate
certain risk exposures.

**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**24. Financial Risk Management (Continued)**

**_Market risk_**

**_Interest rate risk:_** The Group is subject to market risks relating to changes in interest rates
because it has floating rate debt outstanding. Significant increases in interest rates could adversely
affect the Group’s results of operations and its ability to service its debt. The Group uses interest rate
swaps to reduce its exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates. The principal objective of
these contracts is to minimize risks associated with its floating rate debt and not for speculative or
trading purposes. As of December 31, 2019, the Group has economically hedged 44.22% of its variable
rate interest exposure relating to its existing loan facilities and the bonds by swapping the variable rate
to a fixed rate (December 31, 2018: 47.92%).

The aggregate principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt as of December 31, 2019 was
$1,600,408. As an indication of the extent of our sensitivity to interest rate changes, an increase in
LIBOR of 10 basis points would increase the interest expense on the un-hedged portion of the Group’s
loans by approximately $1,530 (December 31, 2018: $1,395 and December 31, 2017: $1,264).

**_Interest rate sensitivity analysis:_** The fair value of the interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2019
was estimated as a net liability of $49,873 (December 31, 2018: net asset of $5,992).

The interest rate swap agreements described below are subject to market risk as they are recorded
at fair value in the statement of financial position at year end. The fair value of interest rate swap
liabilities increases when interest rates decrease and decreases when interest rates increase. As of
December 31, 2019, if interest rates had increased or decreased by 10 basis points with all other
variables held constant, the positive/(negative) impact, respectively, on the fair value of the interest rate
swaps would have amounted to $6,285 (December 31, 2018: $7,351 and December 31, 2017: $4,416)
affecting loss/(gain) on swaps in the respective periods.

**_Other price risk:_** The decrease in the fair value of Egypt LNG Shipping Ltd., in response to
unfavorable market conditions resulting in a decrease in charter rates and vessel values, could
negatively impact the value of the Group’s investment in associate. Therefore, management might
conclude that impairment is necessary in the future.

**_Currency risk:_** Currency risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments and/or the cost of
commercial transactions will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Currency risk arises
when future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a
currency that is not the Group’s subsidiaries’ functional currency. The Group is exposed to foreign
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to general and crew costs
denominated in EUR. Specifically, for the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately $113,804 of
the operating and administrative expenses were denominated in EUR (December 31, 2018: $116,252
and December 31, 2017: $87,400). As of December 31, 2019, approximately $27,766 of the Group’s
outstanding trade payables and accruals were denominated in EUR (December 31, 2018: $21,177).

The Group has entered into CCSs (Note 26) to hedge its currency exposure from the NOK 2021
Bonds, the NOK 2024 Bonds and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency exposure
from payments in EUR, GBP, SGD and JPY. In addition, management monitors exchange rate
fluctuations on a continuous basis. As an indication of the extent of the Group’s sensitivity to changes

in exchange rate, a 10% increase in the average EUR/USD exchange rate would have decreased the
Group’s profit and cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2019 by $11,380, based upon its
expenses during the year (December 31, 2018: $11,625 and December 31, 2017: $8,740).

**_Interest rate risk on NOK 2024 Bonds (cash flow hedge):_** The Group uses approved instruments
such as CCSs, in order to reduce the variability of the cash flows associated with the functional
currency equivalent interest and principal of the NOK 2024 Bonds as well as changes in the cash flows
associated with changes in the currency rates and is therefore exposed to the following interest rate
benchmarks within its hedge accounting relationship, which are subject to interest rate benchmark
reform: USD LIBOR and NIBOR (collectively ‘‘IBORs’’).

The Group has closely monitored the market and the output from the various industry working
groups managing the transition to new benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by
LIBOR regulators (including the Financial Conduct Authority (‘‘FCA’’) and the US Commodity Futures
Trading Commission) regarding the transition away from IBORs to the Secured Overnight Financing
Rate (‘‘SOFR’’) and the Norwegian Overnight Weighted Average (‘‘NOWA’’) respectively. The FCA
has made clear that, at the end of 2021, it will no longer seek to persuade or compel banks to submit
LIBOR estimates.

The Group believes that all areas potentially impacted (including borrowings, derivative financial
instruments etc.) have been identified.

The Group’s NOK 2024 Bonds agreement includes fall back provisions for a case of cessation of
the referenced benchmark interest rate. Specifically, it states that in the case that the interest rate
referenced IBOR is no longer available, the interest rate will be set by the bond trustee in consultation
with the issuer to: (i) any relevant replacement reference rate generally accepted in the market; or
(ii) such interest rate that best reflects the interest rate for deposits in the bond currency offered for
the relevant interest period. In each case, if any such rate is below zero, the reference rate will be
deemed to be zero.

For the Group’s CCSs, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s (‘‘ISDA’’) fall back
clauses were made available at the end of 2019. These clauses or similar language has been inserted
into a number of ISDA agreements across the Group and all outstanding agreements will be considered
on a case by case basis with its counterparty.

The Group will continue to apply the amendments to IFRS 9/IAS 39 until the uncertainty arising
from the interest rate benchmark reforms with respect to the timing and the amount of the underlying
cash flows that the Group is exposed ends. The Group has assumed that this uncertainty will not end
until the Group’s contracts that reference IBORs are amended to specify the date on which the interest
rate benchmark will be replaced, the cash flows of the alternative benchmark rate and relevant spread
adjustment.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that arises when the maturity of assets and liabilities does not match. An
unmatched position potentially enhances profitability, but can also increase the risk of losses. The
Group minimizes liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and by having
available adequate amounts of undrawn credit facilities.

The following tables detail the Group’s expected cash flows for its non-derivative financial
liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities
based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to discharge its obligations and cause a financial
loss and arises from cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, favorable derivative financial
instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers,
including trade and other receivables, dividends receivable and other amounts due from related parties.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by any of its counterparties. To
limit this risk, the Group currently deals primarily with financial institutions and customers with high

For the year ended December 31, 2019, 70.0% of the Group’s revenue was earned from Shell
(December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 74.2% and 92.6%, respectively) and accounts receivable
were not collateralized; however, management believes that the credit risk is partially offset by the
creditworthiness of the Group’s counterparties. BG Group was acquired by Shell on February 15, 2016.
This acquisition does not impact the contractual obligations under the existing charter party
agreements. The Group did not experience significant credit losses on its accounts receivable portfolio
during the three years ended December 31, 2019. The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in
the consolidated financial statements represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk.
Management monitors exposure to credit risk, and they believe that there is no substantial credit risk
arising from the Group’s counterparties.

The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the
counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

**25. Capital Risk Management**

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern, to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to
support its business and maximize shareholders value.

The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is total debt divided by total equity plus
total debt. The gearing ratio is calculated as follows:

**Interest rate swap agreements**

The Group enters into interest rate swap agreements which convert the floating interest rate
exposure into a fixed interest rate in order to hedge a portion of the Group’s exposure to fluctuations
in prevailing market interest rates. Under the interest rate swaps, the bank counterparty effects
quarterly floating-rate payments to the Group for the notional amount based on the U.S. dollar
LIBOR, and the Group effects quarterly payments to the bank on the notional amount at the
respective fixed rates.

**_Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments_**

As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, there are no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow
hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

**26. Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued)**

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the net loss of $55,865 derived from changes in the LIBOR
curve.

**Cross currency swap agreements**

The Group entered into CCSs which converted the floating interest rate exposure and the
variability of the USD functional currency equivalent cash flows into a fixed interest rate and principal
on maturity with respect to the NOK 2021 Bonds and maintains CCSs which convert the floating
interest rate exposure and the variability of the USD functional currency equivalent cash flows into a
floating interest rate and principal on maturity with respect to NOK 2024 Bonds, in order to hedge the
Group’s exposure to fluctuations deriving from Norwegian Krone (‘‘NOK’’).

The CCSs are designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes.

The principal terms of the CCSs designated as cash flow hedging instruments were as follows:

**Notional Amount**
**Fixed**

**Total** **90,150** **98,550**


(1) On November 27, 2019, the Group decreased the notional amount of the three CCSs by paying their fair value on that
date. On December 23, 2019, the Group terminated these CCSs while their fair value was paid on January 31, 2020
together with the NOK 2021 Bonds final repayment. The cumulative loss of $697 from the period that hedging was
effective was recycled to profit or loss during the year ended December 31, 2019.

(2) On November 27, 2019, in conjunction with the issuance of the NOK 2024 Bonds, the Group entered into these CCSs to
exchange interest payments and principal on maturity on the same terms as the NOK 2024 Bonds.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of CCSs
amounting to a loss of $3,215 has been recognized in Other comprehensive income (December 31,
2018: $5,543 loss, December 31, 2017: $7,291 gain). For the year ended December 31, 2019, a loss of
$607 was recycled to profit or loss representing the realized loss on CCSs in relation to the interest
expenses component of the hedge (December 31, 2018: $454 loss, December 31, 2017: $398 loss).
Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2019, a loss of $325 was recognized in Other
comprehensive income in relation to the retranslation of the NOK 2021 Bonds in U.S. dollars as of
December 31, 2019 (December 31, 2018: $4,831 gain, December 31, 2017: $5,022 loss).

**Forward foreign exchange contracts**

The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign exchange transaction
exposures in British Pounds Sterling (‘‘GBP’’), Euros (‘‘EUR’’), Singapore dollars (‘‘SGD’’) and
Japanese Yen (‘‘JPY’’). Under these forward foreign exchange contracts, the bank counterparty will

**26. Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued)**

between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the periods presented. The definitions of the levels provided by
IFRS 13 are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

-  Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities;

-  Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as
prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and

-  Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs
for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

**27. Cash Flow Reconciliations**

The reconciliation of the Group’s non-cash investing and financing activities for the two years
ended December 31, 2019 are presented in the tables below:

A reconciliation of borrowings arising from financing activities is as follows:

**GasLog Ltd. and its Subsidiaries**
**Notes to the consolidated financial statements (Continued)**
**For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019**
**(All amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except share and per share data)**

**28. Taxation (Continued)**

Under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), the U.S.
source gross transportation income of a ship-owning or chartering corporation, such as GasLog, is
subject to a 4% U.S. Federal income tax without allowance for deduction, unless that corporation
qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. U.S. source gross transportation income consists of 50% of the gross shipping
income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end,
in the United States.

GasLog has qualified for the statutory tax exemption for the year of 2019 and intends to continue
to qualify for the foreseeable future.

**29. Earnings/(losses) per share (‘‘EPS’’)**

Basic earnings/(losses) per share was calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year
attributable to the owners of the common shares after deducting the dividend on Preference Shares by
the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the year.

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to the owners of the
Group adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares by the weighted average number
of all potential ordinary shares assumed to have been converted into common shares, unless such
potential ordinary shares have an antidilutive effect.

The following reflects the earnings/(losses) and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings/
(losses) per share computations:

The Group excluded the effect of 2,630,173 SARs and 367,162 RSUs in calculating diluted EPS for
the year ended December 31, 2019, as they were anti-dilutive (December 31, 2018: 555,453 SARs and
0 RSUs, December 31, 2017: 998,502 SARs and 0 RSUs).
