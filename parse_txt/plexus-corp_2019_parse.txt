**ITEM 1.  BUSINESS**

**Overview**


**PART I**


Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Plexus," the "Company," or "we") participate in the Electronic Manufacturing Services ("EMS") industry. We partner
with our customers to create the products that build a better world. Since 1979, Plexus has been partnering with companies to transform concepts into branded
products and deliver them to the market. From idea to aftermarket and everything in between, Plexus is a global leader in providing support for all the facets of the
product realization process - Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing, and Aftermarket Services. Plexus
delivers comprehensive end-to-end solutions in the Americas ("AMER"), Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC") regions for our
customers.

We specialize in working in industries with highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. Plexus has partnerships with approximately 140

customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences, Industrial/Commercial, Aerospace/Defense and Communications market sectors. We leverage our expertise to
understand the unique needs of our customers' markets and have aligned our processes to provide flexibility, create efficiency and deliver superior quality. Our
customers have stringent quality, reliability and regulatory requirements, requiring exceptional production and supply chain agility. Their products require
complex configuration management, direct order fulfillment (to end customers), global logistics management and aftermarket services. In order to service the
complexities that our customers' products demand, we utilize our full suite of solution offerings to support our customers’ products from concept to end of life.

Plexus is passionate about being a global leader at serving markets consisting of highly complex customer programs and demanding regulatory environments. Our
customers look to us to fulfill programs characterized by unique flexibility, technology, quality and regulatory requirements. To deliver on our strategy, we align
our operations, processes, workforce and financial metrics to create:

-  A high performance, accountable organization with a talented workforce that is deeply passionate about driving growth through customer service
excellence;

-  Strategic growth by using customer driven, sector based go-to-market strategies;
and

-  Execution driven by a collaborative, customer-centric culture that continuously evaluates and optimizes our business processes to strive to create
shareholder value.

We operate flexible manufacturing facilities and design our processes to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations. One or more
uniquely configured "focus factories," supported by tailored supply chain and logistics solutions, are designed to meet the flexibility and responsiveness needed to
support customer fulfillment requirements.

We accomplish our go-to-market strategy through the four market sectors we serve. Each sector has a market sector vice president, as well as business development
and customer management leaders who together oversee and provide leadership to teams that include business development directors, customer directors or
managers, supply chain, engineering and manufacturing subject matter experts, and market sector analysts. These teams maintain expertise related to each market
sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market’s unique quality and regulatory requirements.

Our market sector teams help define Plexus' strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-added solutions we offer customers. Our sales
and marketing efforts focus on targeting new customers and expanding business with existing customers. We believe our ability to provide a full range of product
realization services gives us a business advantage.

Our financial model aligns with our business strategy. Our primary focus is to earn a return on invested capital ("ROIC") 500 basis points above our weighted
average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "Economic Return." We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; for fiscal 2019, our WACC
was 9.0%. We believe economic profit is a fundamental driver of shareholder value. Plexus measures economic profit by taking the difference between ROIC and
WACC and multiplying it by invested capital. By exercising discipline to generate a ROIC in excess of our WACC, with focus on economic profit, our goal is to
ensure that we create value for our shareholders. For more information regarding ROIC and Economic Return, which are non-GAAP financial measures, refer to
"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return" in Part II,
Item 7. For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared using accounting principles

generally accepted in the U.S. ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP"), see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, flexibility and fulfillment requirements, and complex regulatory
requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us. The cost variance from our competitors is especially
evident relative to those that provide EMS services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).

Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with other technology pioneering start-ups and
emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities. In addition to prime technology advancements, key government and policy trends
impact our business, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s ("FDA") approval of new medical devices, defense procurement practices, and other
government and regulatory processes. Plexus may benefit from increasing outsourcing trends.

We provide most of our optimized solutions on a turnkey basis, and we typically procure all materials required for product assembly. We provide select services on
a consignment basis, meaning the customer supplies the necessary materials and Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly. In
addition to manufacturing, turnkey service requires material procurement and warehousing and involves greater resource investments than consignment services.
Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment, and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary
products.

Established in 1979 as a Wisconsin corporation, we have over 19,000 employees, including over 3,300 engineers and technologists dedicated to product
development and design, test equipment development and design, and manufacturing process development and control, all of whom operate from 26 active
facilities, totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. Plexus' facilities are strategically located to support the global supply chain, engineering, manufacturing,
and aftermarket service needs of customers in our targeted market sectors.

Plexus maintains a website at www.plexus.com. As soon as is reasonably practical, after we electronically file or furnish all reports to the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), we provide online copies of such reports, free of charge. These reports include: Proxy Statements, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Specialized Disclosure Reports on Form SD, and amendments to those reports. These reports are also
accessible at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is also posted on our website. You may access these SEC reports and
the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics by following the links under "Investors" at our website.

**Solutions**

With integrated Design and Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Aftermarket Services, we proactively tackle
tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. It is how our teams strive to create innovative and efficient paths to get products to market.

**Design and Development - Plexus was established with engineering as a core competency and has built a reputation for success. Our customers are able to partner**
with a collaborative team of approximately 675 development engineers to create new products. Using the same tools and processes throughout our eight Design
Centers worldwide, we leverage the latest technology and state-of-the-art design automation methodologies to provide comprehensive new product development
and value engineering solutions.

**Supply Chain Solutions - Delivering an optimal supply chain solution is more than simply getting a product where it needs to be on time. We take a unique**
approach. Our supply chain experts engage in all of Plexus’ integrated solutions, working closely with our engineers to identify opportunities for supply chain
optimization early in the design stage. At Plexus, we take pride in managing the full supply chain to minimize cost, mitigate risk and provide a flexible, scalable
solution for our customers.

**New Product Introduction - When introducing a new product, customers need to move quickly. Plexus offers a dedicated team focused on decreasing time to**
market with a full suite of integrated new product introduction services. Through early integration and collaboration, customers can take advantage of Plexus’
capabilities, such as design for excellence (DFX), specialized design of test solutions and rapid prototyping, while the project is advanced by a dedicated Plexus
transition management team.

**Manufacturing - Our approach to manufacturing focuses on innovation, continuous improvement and superior quality and delivery. With a global footprint and**
scalable operations, we aim to tailor our manufacturing environment to meet each

Table of Contents

customer’s needs worldwide. As we strive for zero defects, we endeavor to empower all employees with the knowledge that exceptional quality begins with each
individual member of our team. As a result, we believe Plexus is positioned to support the complex technology and regulatory needs of the industries we serve and
to provide customers with innovative and dependable manufacturing services.

**Aftermarket Services - From product deployment all the way through a product’s end of life, Plexus offers a full range of aftermarket services. We help our**
customers manage and extend the lifecycle of their products through an optimized level of service. With services such as depot repair, service parts logistics
management, order management, distribution and warehousing, and recycling, we are committed to protecting the success of each customer's product.

**Regulatory Requirements**

All Plexus manufacturing and engineering facilities are certified to a baseline Quality Management System standard per ISO9001:2015. We have capabilities to
assemble finished medical devices meeting FDA Quality Systems Regulation requirements and similar regulatory requirements in other countries.

We have additional certifications and/or registrations held by certain facilities in the following regions:

AMER APAC EMEA

**Customers and Market Sectors Served**

Our customers range from large multinational companies to smaller emerging technology companies. During fiscal 2019, we served approximately 140 customers.

We offer advanced design and production capabilities, allowing our customers to concentrate on their core competencies. Plexus helps accelerate our customers'
time to market, reduce their investment in engineering and manufacturing capacity, and optimize total product cost.

General Electric Company ("GE") accounted for 12.4%, 12.3% and 12.2% of our net sales during fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other customer

accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years.

Net sales to our largest customers may vary from time to time depending on the size and timing of customer program commencements, terminations, delays,
modifications and transitions. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers. Customers' forecasts can and do change as a
result of changes in their end-market demand and other factors, including global economic conditions. Any material change in forecasts or orders from these major
accounts, or other customers, could materially affect our results of operations. The loss of any major customer could have a significant negative impact on our
financial results. In addition, as our percentage of net sales to customers in a specific sector becomes larger relative to other sectors, we will become increasingly
dependent upon the economic and business conditions affecting that sector. Many of our large customers contract with us through multiple independent divisions,
subsidiaries,


-----

Table of Contents

production facilities or locations. We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.

The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table:

Industry 2019 2018 2017

Healthcare/Life Sciences 38% 36% 34%

Industrial/Commercial 31% 32% 31%

Aerospace/Defense 19% 16% 16%

Communications 12% 16% 19%

Total net sales 100% 100% 100%

Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources
geographically (see Note 11 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments). Plexus offers a uniform array of services for
customers in each market sector and, aside from the specific go-to-market teams, we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources
to particular market sectors, nor internally track our costs and resources per market sector.

**Materials and Suppliers**

We typically purchase raw materials, including PCBs and electronic components, from manufacturers and distributors. Under certain circumstances, we will
purchase components from brokers, customers, or competitors. The key electronic components we purchase include: specialized components, semiconductors,
interconnect products, electronic subassemblies (including memory modules, power supply modules and cable and wire harnesses), inductors, resistors, and
capacitors.

We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered, components used in manufacturing and higher-level assembly. These components include
molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and
various other hardware and fastener components. These components are sourced from both Plexus preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers.
Components range from standard to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price.

Component shortages and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk to the electronics industry, and have particularly been an issue for us and the
industry from time to time. We discuss the causes of these shortages more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein. We actively manage our business to
minimize our exposure to material and component shortages.

Plexus' global supply chain management organization attempts to create strong supplier alliances and ensure a steady flow of components and products at
competitive prices. We strive to achieve these goals through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, risk management tools
and global expediting processes. Plexus can often influence the selection of new product components when engaged to provide design and development solutions.

**Competition**

Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers. With integrated Design and
Development, Supply Chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Aftermarket Services, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the
product lifecycle. A number of competitors may provide electronics manufacturing and engineering services similar to Plexus. Others may be more established in
certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing, or marketing resources. Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within
limited geographic areas. Plexus also competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers. Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our
competitors' capabilities in order to remain highly competitive within our target markets.

**Intellectual Property**

We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries. Although we
own certain patents, they are not currently material to our business. We do not have any material copyrights.


-----

Table of Contents

**Information Technology**

Our core solutions for manufacturing facilities include a single-instance Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system, as well as Product Data Management and
Advanced Planning and Scheduling systems, along with consistent solutions for warehouse management and shop floor execution, that support our global
operations. This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize our ability to translate data from multiple
production facilities into operational and financial information required by the business. The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on
terms customary for these types of agreements. Enhancing cybersecurity continues to be a priority and we have several initiatives underway that are intended to
further advance our security posture.

**Environmental Compliance**

We are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to air emission standards and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used
during our manufacturing process. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state, and foreign environmental laws and do not anticipate any
significant expenditures in maintaining our compliance; however, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur which could have a material adverse
effect on our financial results.

**Social Responsibility**

Plexus is committed to social responsibility throughout our global business operations. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"), we have taken
an active role in improving not only our own practices, but influencing and holding others accountable throughout our supply chain to improve their focus on
important social principles. We consider a variety of standards for socially responsible practices, including, but not limited to, local and federal legal requirements
in the jurisdictions where we operate, the International Organization for Standardization’s "Guidance for Social Responsibility" (ISO 26000) and standards
established by the RBA. Our commitment to social responsibility focuses on four key areas: (1) responsible employer, (2) community steward, (3) global citizen
and (4) industry steward.

**Responsible Employer - We advocate for diversity, combat human trafficking activities, encourage and provide employee development opportunities, strive to**
ensure safe and healthy working conditions, promote an appropriate work/life balance for our employees, encourage wellness initiatives and reinforce responsible
values in our culture.

**Community Steward - We promote and financially contribute to programs involving science and technology in education and causes that make a meaningful**
impact to the communities in which we operate. We encourage our employees' involvement in community charitable organizations, as well as volunteerism, and we
partner with community organizations to promote local business.

**Global Citizen - We actively work to reduce waste, water use and greenhouse gas emissions from our operations, work with suppliers to develop similar programs**
and partner with customers to help design more efficient and environmentally friendly products.

**Industry Steward - We take an active role in industry coalitions focused on improving working conditions around the world, the environment and ethical business**
practices. We train our supply chain on important social initiatives, such as detecting and preventing forced labor, and we collaborate with customers to advance
sustainability initiatives.

**Employees**

We make a considerable effort, and invest at all levels of the organization, to maintain a highly qualified and engaged work force. We offer enhanced career
opportunities to many of our employees. Our human resources department identifies career objectives and monitors specific skill development opportunities for
employees with potential for advancement. We have a policy of involvement and consultation with employees at every facility and strive for continuous
improvement at all levels.

We employ over 19,000 employees. Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary
to maximize efficiency. To do so we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees. Approximately 250 and 1,500 of our employees in the
United Kingdom and Mexico, respectively, are covered by union agreements. These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year,
although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years. Our employees in China, Germany, Malaysia, Romania and the United States are not covered
by union agreements. We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are generally positive and stable.

**ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS**

**Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period.**

Our quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:

-  the volume and timing of customer demand relative to our
capacity

-  the effects of shortages and delays in obtaining components as a result of economic cycles, natural disasters or otherwise

-  the life-cycle of our customers' technology-dependent
products

-  customers' operating results and business conditions

-  failure of our customers to pay amounts due to
us

-  changes in our, and our customers', sales mix, as well as the volatility of these
changes

-  variations in sales and margins among geographic regions and market
sectors

-  changes in tariffs, trade agreements and other trade protection
measures

-  varying gross margins among different programs, including as a result of pricing concessions to certain
customers

-  claims alleging defective goods or services or breaches of contractual
requirements

-  challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or additional programs or services for existing
customers

-  disengagements with customers

-  changes in customer supply chain strategies

-  the timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future
orders

-  our effectiveness in planning and executing production, and managing inventory, fixed assets and manufacturing
processes

-  changes in the cost and availability of labor and
components

-  changes in exchange rates

-  changes in accounting
rules

-  changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, or negative or unforeseen tax consequences,
and

-  changes in U.S. and global economic and political conditions and world
events.

**The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose a major customer or**
**if there are challenges in those market sectors, our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.**

Net sales to our 10 largest customers have represented a majority of our net sales in recent periods. Our 10 largest customers accounted for 54.6% of our net sales

for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, and 57.2% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018. During each of the fiscal years ended

September 28, 2019, and September 29, 2018, there was one customer that represented 10.0% or more of our net sales.

Our major customers may vary from period to period, and our major customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all,
particularly given the volatile nature of certain programs. In any given period, a higher portion of our sales may be concentrated with customers or projects with
relatively lower margins, which could adversely affect our results. We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant
disengagements with customers or of programs, adverse changes in customer supply chain strategies and the end of life of significant programs. Especially given
our discrete number of customers, significant reductions in net sales to any of our major customers, the loss of major customers or our failure to make appropriate
choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations in such periods.

In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors. Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends
and conditions that are sector specific. Economic, business or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or the Company’s failure to choose appropriate sectors,
can particularly impact Plexus. For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as
government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the U.S. healthcare sector generally. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has historically been
subject to significant cyclicality and volatility.

Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect
opportunities in all of our market sectors. Any weakness in our customers' end markets could affect our business and results of operations.


-----

Table of Contents

We rely on timely and regular payments from our customers, and also have receivables factoring agreements in place; therefore, deterioration in the payment
experience with or credit quality of our major customers, or issues with the counterparties to our factoring agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations. The inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or
liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time, our customers, including formerly major customers, have been affected by merger, acquisition, divestiture and spin-off activity. While these
transactions may present Plexus with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially reduce their purchases or
completely disengage from us as a result of transitioning such business to Plexus' competitors or deciding to manufacture the products internally.

**Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and**
**currency risks.**

We have operations in many countries; operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular
concentration in Malaysia. In addition, although we have repatriated a substantial amount of cash since the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax
Reform" or "Tax Reform"), a significant amount of our cash balances remain held outside of the U.S., with a particular concentration in Malaysia and China. We
purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries. These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over
time, subject us to the following risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results:

-  economic, political or civil instability

-  transportation delays or
interruptions

-  exchange rate
fluctuations

-  potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the
U.S.

-  changes in labor markets, such as government-mandated wage increases, increases to minimum wage requirements, changes in union-related laws and
regulations, limitations on immigration or the free movement of labor or restrictions on the use of migrant workers, and difficulties in appropriately
staffing and managing personnel in diverse cultures

-  compliance with laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, applicable
to companies with global operations

-  changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"), including as a result of the expected approval of the United States-Mexico-Canada
Agreement (the "USMCA")

-  changes in the taxation of earnings both in the U.S. and in other countries

-  reputational risks related to, among other factors, varying standards and practices among
countries

-  changes in duty rates

-  significant natural disasters and other events or factors impacting local
infrastructure

-  the impact of the United Kingdom’s expected exit from the European Union
("Brexit")

-  the effects of other international political developments, such as tariffs, embargoes, sanctions, boycotts, trade wars, energy disruptions, trade agreements
and changes in trade policies, including those which may be effected by the current U.S. presidential administration and other countries' reactions to
those actions, and

-  regulatory requirements and potential changes to those
requirements.

We continue to monitor our risk associated with foreign currency and have entered into limited forward contracts to address this risk. As our international
operations continue to expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities
denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition,
developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries.

A significant portion of our operations currently occurs in the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia. The concentration of our operations, assets and profitability
in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries.

Changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to trade wars, changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, currency
exchange rate fluctuations, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping
them to, specific countries. In 2018, Canada, Mexico and the United States negotiated the USMCA, which is intended to update and replace NAFTA and is subject
to ratification by all three countries before it becomes fully effective, with many of its provisions not effective until calendar year 2020. The USMCA is similar to
NAFTA; however, it contains several new compliance obligations addressing such issues as rules of origin, labor

standard, certificate of origin documentation and de minimis thresholds, as well as new policies on labor and environmental standards, intellectual property
protections and some digital trade provisions. While certain aspects of the USMCA may be positive, others, including potentially higher regulatory compliance
costs, may have a negative impact on our business and adversely affect our operations in Mexico. Also, our current facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican
Maquiladora ("IMMEX") program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations. We could be adversely affected by changes in the
IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements. Additionally, increasing tariffs and other trade protection measures between the U.S. and China
may affect the cost of our products originating in China as well as the demand for our products manufactured in China in the event our customers reduce operations
in China as a result of such tariffs or trade protection measures. These actions could also affect the cost and/or availability of components that we procure from
suppliers in China.

The United Kingdom's expected exit from the European Union has resulted in currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility. The terms of Brexit are not yet
known as negotiations continue between the U.K. and the E.U. Given the lack of comparable precedent, the implications of Brexit, or how such implications might
affect the Company (which also has operations in Scotland), remain unclear at this time. Brexit could, among other impacts, disrupt trade and the movement of
goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries, disrupt the stability of the European Union generally, and
lead to a downturn in consumer sentiment as well as overall negative economic growth, as well as create legal, political, regulatory and global economic
uncertainty. These and other potential implications could adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.

**Our customers do not make long-term commitments and may cancel or change their production requirements.**

Companies in our industry must respond quickly to the requirements of their customers in both design and production. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term
purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand. Customers also cancel requirements, change
engineering or other service requirements, change production quantities, delay production, or revise or fail to meet their forecasts for a number of reasons that are
beyond our control, and customer expectations can change requiring us to take on additional commitments or risks. In addition, customers may also fail to meet
their commitments to us or our expectations. The success of our customers’ products in the market and the strength of the markets themselves affect our business.
Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our
working capital levels. Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future.

In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers' requirements, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and
accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital (including inventory) management, facility and capacity requirements,
personnel needs and other resource requirements. The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their
products reduce our ability to accurately estimate their future requirements. Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed, a reduction in customer demand
can harm our operating results. The need for us to correctly anticipate component needs is amplified in times of shortages. The current environment of tight
component supply can increase the difficulties and cost of anticipating changing demand. Moreover, because our margins vary across customers and specific
programs, a reduction in demand with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.

Rapid increases in customer requirements may stress personnel and other capacity resources. We may not have sufficient resources, including personnel and
components, at any given time to meet all of our customers' demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business
from such customers.

**We have a complex business model, and our failure to properly manage or execute on that model, as well as an inability to maintain our engineering,**
**technological and manufacturing process expertise, could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation.**

Our business model focuses on products and services in the highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments segment of our industry. Our
customers' products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility, in some cases necessitating optimized demand-pull-based manufacturing
and supply chain solutions across an integrated global platform. The products we manufacture are also typically complex, heavily regulated, and require
complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers. In addition, we offer Aftermarket Services to our
customers, which add to the complexity of our business model.


-----

Table of Contents

Our business model requires a great degree of attention, flexibility and resources. These resources include working capital, management and technical personnel,
and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse manufacturing, regulatory and service requirements for multiple programs of
varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies. We also depend on securing and ramping new customers and programs and on
transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for
companies that did not previously outsource such activities.

The complexity of our service model, which encompasses a broad range of services in the product realization process including Design and Development, Supply
chain Solutions, New Product Introduction, Manufacturing and Aftermarket Services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations as well as
commitments from us to our customers. In addition, customer expectations have also increased in recent years with respect to certain capabilities, commitments,
allocation of risk and compliance with third party standards. If we fail to meet those obligations, are otherwise unable to execute on our commitments or
unsuccessfully mitigate such risks, it could result in claims against us or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair
our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts.

In addition, if we fail to effectively manage or execute our business model, we also may lose customer confidence and our reputation may suffer. The Company's
reputation is the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, which could negatively
impact sentiments toward the Company, our ability to maintain or expand business opportunities could be impaired and our financial results could suffer on a
going-forward basis.

Many of the markets for our manufacturing, engineering, aftermarket and other services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process
developments. Our internal processes are also subject to these factors. The continued success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:

-  retain our qualified engineering and technical personnel, and attract additional qualified personnel, especially in times of tight labor
markets

-  maintain and enhance our technological
capabilities

-  choose and maintain appropriate technological and service
capabilities

-  successfully manage the implementation and execution of information
systems

-  develop and market services that meet changing customer
needs

-  effectively execute our services and perform to our customers' expectations,
and

-  successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely
basis.

Although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we
cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards
or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may have to acquire new design,
assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive, as well as offer new or additional services, all of which may require significant expense or
capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers' changing
technological needs and requirements, or to perform to their expectations or standards, as well as our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during
times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.

**We experience raw material and component shortages and price fluctuations.**

We generally do not have long-term supply agreements. We experience, and in the future will likely continue to experience, raw material and component shortages
due to supplier capacity constraints, or their failure to deliver. We also experience increased lead times to procure certain types of components from time to time,
including during fiscal 2019. Such constraints can also be caused by world events, such as government policies, tariffs, trade wars, trade disputes and trade
protection measures, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, economic recession, increased demand due to economic growth, preferential allocations and other
localized events. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the raw materials and components used in the assembly process and, in some
cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular raw material or component. Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor
disputes, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering raw materials or components timely or at all. Supply
shortages and delays in deliveries of raw materials or components have in some cases resulted in delayed production of assemblies, which have increased our
inventory levels and adversely affected our operating results in certain periods. Additionally, a delay in obtaining a particular component may result in other
components for the related project being held for longer periods of time, increasing working capital and risking inventory obsolescence. An inability to obtain
sufficient

10

Table of Contents

inventory on a timely basis or successfully execute on our business continuity processes, could also harm relationships with our customers.

In addition, raw materials and components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria. Certain materials provided to us may
be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others. The need to obtain replacement materials and parts may negatively affect our manufacturing
operations. The inadvertent use of any such parts or products may also give rise to liability claims. Further, the commitments made to us by our suppliers, and the
terms applicable to such relationships, may not match all the commitments we make to, and the terms of our arrangements with, our customers, and such variations
may lead us to incur additional expense or liability and/or cause other disruptions to our business.

Raw material and component supply shortages and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as tariffs and trade disputes, can also result in increased
pricing. While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in raw material or component prices and other
factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the
particular customer contract. Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, raw material and component price reductions have contributed
positively to our operating results in the past. Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results.

**Our services involve other inventory risk.**

Most of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts
or orders. Suppliers may require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements. A customer's
cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us. Engineering changes by a customer may result
in obsolete materials or components. While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory, require customers to reimburse us for
these items and/or price our services to address related risks, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or in full, be able to collect on these obligations or
adequately reflect such risks in our pricing. In addition to increasing inventory in certain instances to support new program ramps, we may also increase inventory
if we experience component shortages or longer lead times for certain components in order to maintain a high level of customer service. In such situations, we may
procure components earlier, which has led to an increase in inventory in the short term and may lead to increased, excess, or obsolete inventory in the future.
Excess or obsolete inventory, the need to acquire increasing amounts of inventory due to shortages, customer demand or otherwise, or other failures to manage our
working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.

In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories.
These managed inventory programs result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers.
In addition, our inventory may be held at a customer's facility or warehouse, or elsewhere in a location outside of our control, which may increase the risk of loss.
Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to customers' credit risks as well as the
risk of potential customer default and the need to enforce those obligations.

**Our products and services are for end markets that require technologically advanced products.**

Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus. These factors include:

-  the inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards that can result in short product lifecycles

-  the inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and
untested

-  the potential that our customers' products may become obsolete,
and

-  the potential failure of our customers' products to gain widespread commercial
acceptance.

Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business
relationships with them and our production for, or services offered to, them, or to our supply chain for related components, can affect our production cycles,
inventory management and results of operations.

**Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, or the provision of new services, could affect our operations and financial**
**results.**

Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to
opportunities. We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program
or service, including evaluating whether the customer, program or service fits with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success. If we make the
decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the strategic
nature of the customer, anticipated costs, risks and rewards. The failure to make prudent engagement decisions or to establish appropriate terms of engagement
could adversely affect our profitability and margins.

Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of anticipated revenue from a new program or service; these factors can sometimes
extend for a significant period. Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and
competencies. We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver
conforming product or services on a timely basis. Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market
acceptance, regulatory approvals or economic conditions. The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute
on a new program's or service's requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.

**Start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs can adversely affect our operating results.**

In recent years, ramping new programs has been a key contributor to our revenue growth. The management of resources in connection with the establishment of
new or recent programs and customer relationships, as well as program transfers between facilities and geographies, and the need to estimate required resources in
advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital. These factors are particularly evident in the early stages
of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages. We
typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes. In addition, if any of these programs
or customer relationships were delayed or terminated, our operating results could be negatively impacted, particularly in the short-term.

The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies. We conduct these transfers on a
regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures. We may also be
required to transfer projects between facilities due to tariffs and other trade measures impacting particular countries such as China. Although we try to recover costs
from our customers and minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, we may not be
successful and there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.

While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature, or maturing programs and customer relationships,
especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.

**Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.**

Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet
changing customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, as well as fail to realize the anticipated
benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer.

Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to new or other facilities or due to acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and startup inefficiencies. For example, in fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020 construction was completed on additional facilities in Penang, Malaysia, and
Guadalajara, Mexico, respectively, which are intended to supplement our footprint in those particular regions. If we are unable to effectively manage our recent or
future expansions and consolidations, or related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we may expand
our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate. Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:

12


-----

Table of Contents

-  the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other
value

-  challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs

-  incurrence of restructuring costs or other charges that may be insufficient or may not have their intended
effects

-  additional fixed or other costs, or selling and administrative expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by new
business

-  a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities, as well as the increased costs
associated with opening new facilities

-  difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing
plans

-  diversion of management's attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of
expansions

-  strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources,
and

-  inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the
expansion.

Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable,
whether staffing levels need to be reduced, and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of
employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market
improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results. When we make
decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring costs.

In addition, to meet our customers' needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, to achieve increased efficiencies, or
to address factors affecting specific locations, such as tariffs and trade disputes, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity
in another. Since customers’ needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience
the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location. We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain
locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.

**An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these**
**systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.**

As a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers' requirements and to
successfully manage our business. Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our
information systems, including matters related to system and data security, cybersecurity, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any
inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business.

In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our
customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees. Our information systems, like those of other
companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, cyber threats, industrial espionage (internal or
external), hacking, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures. We have taken steps to
maintain adequate data security and address these risks and uncertainties by implementing security technologies, internal controls, network and data center
resiliency, redundancy and recovery processes, as well as by purchasing insurance; however, these measures may not be sufficient. Moreover, we are subject to
increasing expectations and data security requirements from our customers, including those related to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, including the Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or
disclosure of our or our customers' financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory or other legal actions and have a material
adverse effect on our business and reputation.

In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere.
For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") and similar legislation in jurisdictions in which we operate impose additional
obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with
existing, proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and
reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the
Company by governmental entities or others, fines and penalties, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on our business and
results of operations.

**Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could**
**adversely affect our results.**

The Company's effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in tax laws or tax
rates in those jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions by the U.S. (including additional guidance and interpretations related to U.S. Tax
Reform) or other countries or Brexit, could continue to have a material impact on our operating results. Among other things, the Company has been, and is
expected to continue to be, affected by the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") provisions added by U.S. Tax Reform and related new tax legislation,
interpretations and guidance. The Company's effective tax rate may also be impacted by tax holidays and other various tax credits granted by local taxing
authorities. In addition, the implementation of U.S. Tax Reform has required the use of estimates, which may be refined in future periods. All incentives, including
a tax holiday granted to our Malaysian subsidiary, are subject to certain terms and conditions. While we expect to comply with these conditions, we would
experience adverse tax consequences if we are found to not be in compliance or if the terms and conditions of the tax holiday are unfavorably altered by the local
taxing authorities.

The Company's taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon the local taxing authority's acceptance of our operational and intercompany transfer pricing
practices as being at "arm's length." Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm's length standard, the Company’s transfer pricing
methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense. Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted
by the global initiative from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS")
project. The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business. Given the scope of the
Company's international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess
how any changes in tax laws would impact the Company's income tax expense.

The Company reviews the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction. This review
uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other
relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation
allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.

**We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future**
**regulations and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.**

We are subject to extensive government regulation and industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards) relating to the products we design, manufacture
and service as well as how we conduct our business, including regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety,
the environment, sourcing and import/export practices, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations. The regulatory climate in the U.S.
and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory activity has increased in recent periods. A failure to comply with such
regulations or standards could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations.

Particularly as a publicly held company, we are subject to increasingly stringent laws, regulations and other requirements, including those affecting, among other
areas, our accounting, internal controls, data protection and privacy, corporate governance practices, securities disclosures and reporting.

Governments worldwide are becoming increasingly aggressive in adopting and enforcing anti-corruption laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K.
Bribery Act and China's Criminal Law and Anti-Unfair Competition Law, among others, apply to us and our operations.

Changes in healthcare laws and regulations may significantly affect the provision of both healthcare services and benefits in the U.S. and may impact our cost of
providing our employees and retirees with health insurance or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business, such as the demand for products
in our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector.

Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical devices
and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulations and similar regulations in other
countries.

14

Table of Contents

We also design, manufacture and service products for certain industries, including certain applications where the U.S. government is the end customer, that face
significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority, and other governmental
agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially
heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, as well as standards of quality systems, technologies or markets.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in, among other consequences, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure
of devices, or total or partial suspension of production, including debarment, as well as damage to our reputation.

The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services. For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, as well as the financial
health of healthcare providers, and changes in how healthcare in the U.S. is structured, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability
of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in this sector as well as impact our margins.

Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific
regulations discussed above. Our customers' failure to comply could affect their businesses, which in turn would affect our sales to them. In addition, if our
customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs for
these customers and create inefficiencies in our business.

**A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third-party certification requirements or standards, including those related to**
**social responsibility, could adversely affect our business and reputation.**

In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own or third-party quality standards, business
policies, commercial terms, or other social responsibility policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our preexisting policies and/or terms with our suppliers, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. Such policies or standards may be customer-driven,
established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations.

Our compliance with these heightened and/or additional policies, standards and third-party certification requirements, and managing a supply chain in accordance
therewith, could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. In addition, our
adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain
employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices. In certain circumstances, to meet the requirements or standards
of our customers we may be obligated to select certain suppliers or make other sourcing choices, and we may bear responsibility for adverse outcomes even if
these matters are as the result of third-party actions or outside of our control.

**Changes to financial accounting rules or standards, or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators, may have a material**
**adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.**

We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB"), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting
standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB and the SEC. For example, new FASB guidance that impacts revenue recognition criteria
was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. The new standard resulted in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a
significant portion of the Company's revenue stream, whereby revenue is now being recognized "over time" as production occurs as opposed to at a "point in time"
upon physical delivery. The new standard is also expected to continue to affect the Company's ability to forecast financial results in the near term.

See also "Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted" within Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies," in Part II,
Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the expected impact of new standards and/or guidance on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

The products that we design, manufacture or service may be subject to liability or claims in the event that defects are discovered or alleged. We design,
manufacture and service products to our customers' specifications, many of which are highly complex, and produce products for industries, such as healthcare,
aerospace and defense, that have higher risk profiles. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the
design, manufacturing or servicing of these products, including as a result of business continuity issues. Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the
products we manufacture, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, the design or manufacturing processes, servicing, or a
component defect, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too
frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished. In addition, such problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible.
These potential claims may include damages for the recall of a product or injury to person or property.

Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such
costs or required payments to us. While we seek to secure contractual protection and/or to insure against many of these risks, we may not have practical recourse
against certain suppliers, and contractual protections, insurance coverage or supplier warranties, as well as our other risk mitigation efforts, may be inadequate, not
cost effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues. We occasionally incur costs defending claims, and any such disputes
could adversely affect our business relationships.

**Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.**

Our services and the products offered by our customers involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk
of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties. In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual
property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend
significant resources in defense of those claims. In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop noninfringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Infringement by
our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and
disrupt our production.

Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the
supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies. Such
infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products,
and could affect our customer relationships more broadly. Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and
components upon which we rely.

**Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.**

Our industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional
basis. In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing, manufacturing and servicing products internally and may choose
to design, manufacture or service products (including products or product types that we currently design, manufacture or service for them) themselves rather than
outsource such activities. Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape.

Our competitors may:

-  respond more quickly than us to new or emerging
technologies

-  have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic and market
presence

-  be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities

-  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements

-  have lower internal cost structures

-  have greater direct buying power with component suppliers, distributors and raw material
suppliers

-  devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services and execution of their strategy,
and

-  be better positioned to compete on price for their services.

Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may
enter our market or otherwise become increasingly competitive. Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or
loss of market share.

**We depend on our workforce, including certain key personnel, and the loss of key personnel or other personnel disruptions, including the inability to hire**
**and retain sufficient personnel, may harm our business.**

Our success depends in large part on the continued services of our key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to attract, develop and retain
qualified employees, particularly highly skilled design, process and test engineers involved in the development of new products and processes and the manufacture
of products. The competition for these individuals is significant, especially in tight labor markets, and the loss of key employees could harm our business.

From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service that affect
our executive officers and other key employees, including those that are unexpected. Transitions or other changes in responsibilities among officers and key
employees, particularly those that are unanticipated, unplanned or not executed effectively, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, as well
as harm our reputation, which could have an effect on our results.

We also depend on good relationships with our workforce generally. Any disruption in our relationships with our personnel, including as a result of union
organizing activities, work actions, tightening labor markets or other labor issues, could substantially affect our operations and results.

In addition, when we expand operations in either existing areas or new locations, including internationally, we need to attract and retain the services of sufficient
qualified personnel to conduct those operations. If we fail to retain and maintain sufficient qualified personnel, the operations at those locations, and consequently
our financial results, could be adversely affected. In new or existing facilities we may be subject to local labor practices or union activities, wage pressure and
changing wage requirements, increasing healthcare costs, differing employment laws and regulations in various countries, local competition for employees,
restrictions on immigration, labor mobility as well as high turnover, and other issues affecting our workforce, all of which could affect operations at particular
locations, which also could have adverse effects on our operational results. As noted above, our adoption of certain third-party standards could adversely affect our
ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.

**Natural disasters, breaches of security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.**

Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis and
floods. All facilities are subject to other natural or man-made disasters such as those related to weather events or global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or
war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, workplace violence and failures of utilities. If such an event was to occur and we did not have an effective business
continuity plan in place, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event, with
the impact of the event potentially magnified in areas where we have multiple facilities. Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, the loss of business
data and damage to infrastructure.

In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack. If work is disrupted at one of these
facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays. Thus, any disruption
in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and thus
negatively affect our relationships and financial results.

Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible
unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets. If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or
information are stolen, damaged or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other
consequences, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties or other future financial
obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers' data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation and results of operations.

**We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital.**

Although we have credit facilities, we cannot be certain that our existing credit arrangements will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the
future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and
operations and/or increased working capital needs. In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit agreement, our ability to borrow under that
facility would be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit agreement and receivables
factoring programs, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise, which could, among
other impacts, increase the duration of our cash collection cycle.

Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives. During fiscal 2019,
we successfully refinanced our revolving credit facility to, among other changes, expand the maximum commitment from $300 million to $350 million. We also
have the potential to increase capacity under our revolving credit facility from $350 million to $600 million with the approval of the lenders. In addition, we also
have receivables factoring programs. Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates,
including LIBOR, increase. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer persuade or compel panel banks to
submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR, and it is unclear whether the banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021.
Although the consequences of these developments cannot be predicted at this time, should LIBOR no longer be available, the rates under our variable rate
indebtedness could increase and access to capital could be adversely impacted.

We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining
new facilities, or through a combination of these methods. We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, and capital may not be available on
satisfactory terms. If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders' ownership interests; we may
not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price. Furthermore, any additional financing
may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future
financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and
other factors.

**We may fail to successfully complete future acquisitions, as well as strategic arrangements, and may not successfully integrate acquired operations or**
**recognize the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our operating results.**

While we have primarily chosen an organic growth strategy in recent years, we may grow through acquisitions and strategic arrangements, such as our fiscal 2018
acquisition of the assets of one of the business lines of Cascade Controls, Inc. ("Cascade"), a company that provides new product introduction services. If we were
to pursue future growth through acquisitions, including the acquisition of operations divested by our customers, or similar transactions, this would involve
significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. These risks include:

Operating risks, such as:

-  the inability to integrate successfully our acquired operations' businesses, systems and
personnel

-  the inability to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale or other
value

-  the difficulties in scaling up production and coordinating management of operations at new
sites

-  the strain placed on our personnel, systems and
resources

-  the possible modification or termination of an acquired business' customer programs, including the loss of customers and the cancellation of current or
anticipated programs, and

-  the loss of key employees of acquired businesses.

Financial risks, such as:

-  the use of cash resources, or incurrence of additional debt and related interest
expense

-  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity
securities

-  the effect of potential volatility or weakness in our stock price on its use as consideration for
acquisitions

-  the inability to achieve expected operating margins to offset the increased fixed costs associated with acquisitions, or inability to increase margins of
acquired businesses to our desired levels

-  the incurrence of large write-offs or write-downs

-  the impairment of intangible assets, and

-  the unforeseen liabilities of the acquired
businesses.

**_AMER. Net sales for fiscal 2019 in the AMER segment increased $210.4 million, or 17.3%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales was driven by a_**
$181.7 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers, a $13.5 million increase in production ramps for new customers and overall
net increased customer end-market demand. The increase was partially offset by a $16.4 million decrease for end-of-life products and a $6.0 million reduction due
to disengagements with customers.

**_APAC. Net sales for fiscal 2019 in the APAC segment increased $59.2 million, or 4.0%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales was driven by an_**
$87.3 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and a $58.1 million increase in production ramps for new customers. The
increase was partially offset by a $28.4 million reduction due to a disengagement with a customer, a $7.3 million decrease for end-of-life products and overall net
decreased customer end-market demand.

**_EMEA. Net sales for fiscal 2019 in the EMEA segment increased $28.4 million, or 10.1%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales was the result of a_**
$20.2 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers, a $4.2 million increase in production ramps for new customers and overall net
increased customer end-market demand. The increase was partially offset by a $6.2 million reduction due to a disengagement with a customer.

Our net sales by market sector for the indicated fiscal years were as follows (in millions):

**_Healthcare/Life Sciences. Net sales for fiscal 2019 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector increased $180.1 million, or 17.3%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The_**
increase was driven by overall net increased customer end-market demand, a $32.7 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers
and a $26.9 million increase in production ramps for new customers.

**_Industrial/Commercial. Net sales for fiscal 2019 in the Industrial/Commercial sector increased $63.5 million, or 6.9%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase_**
was driven by a $64.8 million increase in production ramps of new products for existing customers and a $33.2 million increase in production ramps for new
customers. The increase was partially offset by a $7.3 million decrease due to end-of-life products, a $4.2 million decrease due to a disengagement with a customer
and overall net decreased customer end-market demand.

**_Aerospace/Defense. Net sales for fiscal 2019 in the Aerospace/Defense sector increased $143.5 million, or 32.2%, as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was_**

Table of Contents

As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10% or more of consolidated net sales as well as the percentage of net
sales attributable to our ten largest customers for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:

2019 2018

General Electric Company ("GE") 12.4% 12.3%

Top 10 customers 54.6% 57.2%

**_Cost of sales. Cost of sales for fiscal 2019 increased $256.7 million, or 9.8%, as compared to fiscal 2018. Cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and_**
component costs, labor costs and overhead. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, approximately 89% of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales
volumes. Of these amounts, approximately 86% and 88% of these costs in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to material and component costs.

As compared to fiscal 2018, the increase in cost of sales in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the increase in net sales and increased fixed costs to support program

ramps. Partially offsetting the increase was a positive shift in customer mix and the $13.5 million one-time employee bonus (the "one-time employee bonus") that
was paid during fiscal 2018, of which $12.6 million impacted cost of sales in that period.

**_Gross profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2019 increased $34.2 million, or 13.3%, as compared to fiscal 2018. Gross margin of 9.2% increased by 20 basis points as_**
compared to fiscal 2018. The primary driver of the increases in gross profit and gross margin as compared to fiscal 2018 was the increase in net sales, a positive
shift in customer mix and the one-time employee bonus that was paid during fiscal 2018.

**_Operating income. Operating income for fiscal 2019 increased $23.8 million, or 20.1%, as compared to fiscal 2018 as a result of the increase in gross profit as well_**
as the non-recurrence of the one-time employee bonus that was paid during fiscal 2018, as noted above. This was partially offset by an $8.8 million increase in
selling and administrative expenses, driven by a $4.9 million increase in compensation expense, and $1.7 million of restructuring costs. Operating margin of 4.5%
increased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the increase in gross margin as a result of the factors discussed above.

A discussion of operating income by reportable segment is presented below (in millions):

2019 2018

Operating income (loss):

AMER $ 57.8 $ 38.6

APAC 208.2 213.9

EMEA 4.5 1.5

Corporate and other costs (128.4) (135.7)

Total operating income $ 142.1 $ 118.3

**_AMER. Operating income increased $19.2 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and a positive shift in_**
customer mix, partially offset by increased fixed costs to support new program ramps.

**_APAC. Operating income decreased $5.7 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, primarily as a result of a negative shift in customer mix and increased_**
fixed costs to support new program ramps, partially offset by the increase in net sales.

**_EMEA. Operating income increased $3.0 million in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and a positive shift in_**
customer mix, partially offset by increased fixed costs to support new program ramps.

**_Other expense. Other expense for fiscal 2019 increased $5.4 million as compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in other expense for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to_**
a $2.7 million decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances and a $1.5 million increase in factoring fees related to the Company's accounts
receivable sale programs.

**_Income taxes. Income tax expense and effective annual income tax rates for fiscal 2019 and 2018, as well as information as to the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform_**

in fiscal 2018, were as follows (dollars in millions):

2019 2018

Income tax expense, as reported (GAAP) $ 17.3 $ 94.6

Accumulated foreign earnings assertion 10.5 —

U.S. Tax Reform (7.0) (85.9)

Impact of other special tax items 0.2 (1.1)

Impact of valuation allowance release — 3.6

Impact of one-time employee bonus — 0.3

Income tax expense, as adjusted (non-GAAP) (1) $ 21.0 $ 11.5

2019 2018

Effective tax rate, as reported (GAAP) 13.8 % 87.9 %

Accumulated foreign earnings assertion 8.4 —

U.S. Tax Reform (5.6) (79.8)

Impact of other special tax items (0.1) (1.0)

Impact of valuation allowance release — 3.4

Impact of one-time employee bonus — (1.0)

Effective tax rate, as adjusted (non-GAAP) (1) 16.5 % 9.5 %

(1) We believe the non-GAAP presentation of income tax expense and the effective annual tax rate excluding special tax items, the one-time employee bonus and
restructuring charges provides additional insight over the change from the comparative reporting periods by isolating the impact of these significant, special items. In
addition, the Company believes that its income tax expense, as adjusted, and effective tax rate, as adjusted, enhance the ability of investors to analyze the Company’s
operating performance and supplement, but do not replace, its income tax expense and effective tax rate calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Income tax expense for fiscal 2019 was $17.3 million compared to $94.6 million for fiscal 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the $85.9 million impact of Tax
Reform that was recorded in fiscal 2018, which was partially offset by an increase in tax expense due to the global intangible low-taxed income provisions
("GILTI") of Tax Reform in fiscal 2019. Income tax expense also decreased by $10.5 million in fiscal 2019 as the Company reasserted that certain historical
undistributed earnings of two foreign subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested based on the expected working capital requirements of these two foreign
subsidiaries.

The $94.6 million of income tax expense recorded during fiscal 2018 included $85.9 million related to the enactment of Tax Reform. Included in the fiscal 2018
income tax expense was a $3.6 million benefit for the valuation allowance released against the net deferred tax assets in the U.S. as the Company is subject to
GILTI.

Our annual effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings as well as a tax
holiday granted to a subsidiary located in the APAC segment where we derive a significant portion of our earnings. Our effective tax rate also may be impacted by
disputes with taxing authorities, tax planning activities, adjustments to uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances.

The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC segment. This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2024, and is
subject to certain conditions with which we expect to continue to comply. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, the holiday resulted in tax reductions of approximately $23.9
million net of the impact of the GILTI provisions of Tax Reform ($0.79 per basic share, $0.77 per diluted share) and $39.1 million ($1.19 per basic share, $1.15
per diluted share), respectively.

See also Note 6, "Income Taxes," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our tax rate.

The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be approximately 13.0% to 15.0%.

**_Net Income. Net income for fiscal 2019 increased $95.6 million, or 735.4%, from fiscal 2018 to $108.6 million. Net income increased primarily as a result of the_**
$77.3 million decrease in income tax expense, which as noted above was substantially due to the impact of Tax Reform in fiscal 2018, as well as the increase in
operating income previously discussed.

**_Diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2019 and 2018, as well as information as to the effects of special events that occurred in the_**

indicated periods, as previously discussed and detailed below, were as follows (dollars in millions):

2019 2018

Diluted earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 3.50 $ 0.38

Restructuring costs, net of tax 0.05 —

U.S. Tax Reform 0.23 2.46

Accumulated foreign earnings assertion (0.35)

One-time employee bonus, net of tax — 0.39

Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (non-GAAP) (1) $ 3.43 $ 3.23

(1) We believe the non-GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share excluding special tax items, consisting of those related to Tax Reform and a change in our permanent
reinvestment assertions related to undistributed earnings of two foreign subsidiaries, as well as restructuring costs and the one-time employee bonus, provide additional
insight over the change from the comparative reporting periods by eliminating the effects of special or unusual items. In addition, the Company believes that its diluted
earnings per share, as adjusted, enhances the ability of investors to analyze the Company’s operating performance and supplements, but does not replace, its diluted earnings
per share calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Diluted earnings per share increased to $3.50 in fiscal 2019 from $0.38 in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of increased net income due to the factors discussed
above and a reduction in diluted shares outstanding due to repurchase activity under the Company's stock repurchase plans.

**_Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and Economic Return. We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of_**
500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), which we refer to as "Economic Return." Our primary focus is on our Economic Return
goal of 5.0%, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate sufficient cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0%. ROIC and
Economic Return are non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and Economic Return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures
provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance. In particular, we provide ROIC and Economic Return because we believe they
offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC and Economic Return as important measures in evaluating the
efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements. We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain
elements of compensation, and certain compensation incentives are based on Economic Return performance.

We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period
for the fiscal year. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same
way. ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

We review our internal calculation of WACC annually. Our WACC was 9.0% for fiscal year 2019 and 9.5% for fiscal year 2018. By exercising discipline to

generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders. Fiscal 2019 ROIC of 13.1% reflects an Economic Return of 4.1%, based
on our weighted average cost of capital of 9.0%, and fiscal 2018 ROIC of 16.1% reflects an Economic Return of 6.6%, based on our weighted average cost of
capital of 9.5% for that fiscal year.

For a reconciliation of ROIC, Economic Return and adjusted operating income (tax effected) to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see
Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $226.3 million as of September 28, 2019, as compared to $297.7 million as of September 29, 2018.

As of September 28, 2019, 96.8% of our cash balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. With the enactment of Tax Reform, we believe that
our offshore cash can be accessed in a more tax efficient manner than before Tax Reform. Currently, we believe that our cash balance, together with cash available
under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and potential share repurchases, if any, for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable
future.

Our future cash flows from operating activities will be reduced by $65.1 million due to cash payments for U.S. federal taxes on the deemed repatriation of

undistributed foreign earnings that are payable over an eight year period that began in fiscal 2019 with the first payment. The table below provides the expected
timing of these future cash outflows, in accordance with the following installment schedule for the remaining seven years (in millions):

Cash provided by operating activities $ 115.3 $ 66.8

Cash used in investing activities $ (89.4) $ (74.6)

Cash used in financing activities $ (97.2) $ (265.5)

**_Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $115.3 million for fiscal 2019, as compared to $66.8 million for fiscal 2018. The increase_**

was primarily due to cash flow improvements (reductions) of:

-  $159.4 million in inventory cash flows driven by inventory management
efforts.

-  $66.4 million in customer deposit cash flows driven by significant deposits received from three
customers.

-  $(150.1) million in accounts payables cash flows driven by reduced purchasing in an effort to manage
inventory.

-  $(66.0) million in accounts receivable cash flows, which resulted primarily from the increase in net
sales.

-  $14.1 million in other current and noncurrent liabilities cash flows driven by an increase in advance payments from
customers.

Days in accounts receivable 55 47

Days in contract assets 10 —

Days in inventory 87 104

Days in accounts payable (55) (66)

Days in cash deposits (17) (12)

Annualized cash cycle 80 73

We calculate days in accounts receivable and contract assets as each balance sheet item for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective
quarter by day. We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable, and cash deposits as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized
cost of sales for the respective quarter by day. We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable, days in contract assets and days in
inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits. On September 30, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09
(“ASU 2014-09”), Revenue Recognition (Topic 606). For the three months ended September 28, 2019, cash cycle days include contract assets and an associated
reduction in inventory. As the guidance was adopted using a modified retrospective approach, no impact to prior periods was required to be recognized.

As of September 28, 2019, annualized cash cycle days increased seven days compared to September 29, 2018 due to the following factors:

Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended September 28, 2019 increased eight days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018. The

increase is primarily attributable to the timing of customer shipments and payments and an unfavorable change in the payment terms mix, partially offset by an
increase in accounts receivable sold under factoring programs.

Days in contract assets for the three months ended September 28, 2019 increased 10 days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018. The increase is

due to the impact of the adoption of Topic 606.

Days in inventory for the three months ended September 28, 2019 decreased 17 days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018. The decrease is

primarily attributable to inventory that was recognized with over time revenue as part of our adoption of Topic 606 as well as inventory management efforts.

Days in accounts payable for the three months ended September 28, 2019 decreased 11 days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018. The

decrease is primarily attributable to reduced purchasing activity in connection with our inventory management efforts.

Days in cash deposits for the three months ended September 28, 2019 increased five days compared to the three months ended September 29, 2018. The increase

was primarily attributable to significant deposits received from two customers to cover higher inventory balances.

**_Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow ("FCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures. FCF was $24.7_**

million for fiscal 2019 compared to $4.0 million for fiscal 2018, an increase of $20.7 million.

Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight to investors into
ongoing financial performance. In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions. We view
FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and can allow us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. FCF is
a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with
GAAP.

Table of Contents

A reconciliation of FCF to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP follows (in millions):

2019 2018

Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 115.3 $ 66.8

Payments for property, plant and equipment (90.6) (62.8)

Free cash flow $ 24.7 $ 4.0

**_Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities were $89.4 million for fiscal 2019 compared to $74.6 million for fiscal 2018. The increase in cash used_**
in investing activities was due to a $27.8 million increase in capital expenditures, primarily to fund both the purchase of equipment and building improvements for
our new manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia, and the construction of a second manufacturing facility in Guadalajara, Mexico. This change was partially
offset by $12.4 million in cash flows used in investing activities for the acquisition of the assets of one of the business lines of Cascade Controls, Inc. in fiscal
2018. See Note 16, "Acquisition," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We utilized available cash and operating cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2019. We currently estimate capital

expenditures for fiscal 2020 will be approximately $60.0 million to $75.0 million.

**_Financing Activities._** Cash flows used in financing activities were $97.2 million for fiscal 2019 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $265.5

million for fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $203.0 million increase in borrowings on our revolving credit facility and a $25.0 million
reduction in the balance of outstanding senior notes as a result of refinancing the notes, as discussed further below. This change was partially offset by a $45.1
million increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock and an $11.1 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

On August 20, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan under which the Company was authorized to repurchase $50.0 million of its

common stock (the "2019 Program"). The 2019 Program commenced upon completion of the 2018 Program, as defined below. During fiscal 2019, the Company
repurchased 54,965 shares under this program for $3.3 million at an average price of $59.66. As of September 28, 2019, $46.7 million of authority remained under

the 2019 Program.

On February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan under which the Company is authorized to repurchase $200.0 million of its

common stock (the "2018 Program"). The 2018 Program commenced upon completion of the 2016 Program, as defined below. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, the
Company completed the 2018 Program by repurchasing 3,129,059 and 343,642 shares under this program for $178.8 million and $21.2 million, at an average price
of $57.15 and $61.61 per share, respectively.

On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a multi-year stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $150.0

million of its common stock beginning in fiscal 2017 (the "2016 Program"). During fiscal 2018, the Company completed the 2016 Program by repurchasing
1,914,596 shares for $115.9 million, at an average price of $60.52 per share.

All shares repurchased under the aforementioned programs were recorded as treasury stock.

On June 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “2018 NPA”) pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of $150.0 million in principal

amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $100.0 million in principal amount of 4.05% Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and $50.0 million in

principal amount of 4.22% Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the “2018 Notes”), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes
customary operational and financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios
such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a makewhole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. At September 28, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2018
NPA.

In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, on June 15, 2018, the Company repaid, on maturity $175.0 million in principal amount of its previous

5.20% Senior Notes.

On May 15, 2019, the Company refinanced its then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Prior Credit Facility") by entering into a new five-year
senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively with the Prior Credit Facility, referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum
commitment from $300.0 million to $350.0 million and extended the maturity from July 5, 2021 to May 15, 2024. The maximum commitment under the Credit
Facility may be further increased to $600.0 million, generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions.
During fiscal 2019, the highest daily borrowing was $250.0 million; the average daily borrowings were $140.7 million. The Company borrowed $1,084.5 million
and repaid $989.5 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility

during fiscal 2019. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Credit Agreement, which are generally consistent with those in the
2018 NPA discussed above. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage
ratio; the fee was 0.175% as of September 28, 2019.

The Credit Agreement and the 2018 NPA allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including
any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases. We have not paid
cash dividends in the past. However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those
already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.

The Company has Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements with MUFG Bank, New York Branch (formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ, Ltd.) (the "MUFG RPA"), and HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA"), under which the Company may elect to sell
receivables, at a discount, on an ongoing basis. The MUFG RPA was amended in fiscal 2019 to increase the maximum facility amount from $260.0 million to
$280.0 million. The maximum facility amount under the HSBC RPA as of September 28, 2019 is $60.0 million. The MUFG RPA is subject to expiration on

December 13, 2019, but will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should not be
extended. The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA discussed above.

The Company sold $919.3 million and $712.9 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, in

exchange for cash proceeds of $913.6 million and $708.6 million, respectively.

In all cases, the sale discount was recorded within "Miscellaneous, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale. For
further information regarding the receivable sale programs, see Note 14, "Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs," in Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Subsequent to September 28, 2019, a significant customer was removed from the MUFG RPA, and we are currently seeking alternatives to mitigate cash flow
impacts. The customer had $40.4 million of outstanding receivables sold as of September 28, 2019.

Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under
the Credit Facility and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months. If our
future financing needs increase, we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various
financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable
terms.

**DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES**

Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2019, other than changes related to revenue

recognition, there were no material changes to these policies. Our more critical accounting estimates are described below:

_Revenue Recognition: ASU 2014-09, Topic 606, which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019, resulted in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a_
significant portion of the Company's revenue, whereby revenue is now recognized over time as products are produced, as opposed to at a point in time based upon
shipping terms. Since adopting the standard, revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not
create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for
performance completed to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. If either of the two
conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which
typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.

The Company recognizes revenue when a contract exists and when, or as, it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a
customer. Contracts are accounted for when they have approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are
identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a
distinct good or service to the customer.

The Company generally enters into a master services arrangement that establishes the framework under which business will be conducted. These arrangements
represent the master terms and conditions of the Company's services that apply to individual orders, but they do not commit the customer to work with, or to
continue to work with, the Company nor do they obligate the customer to any specific volume or pricing of purchases. Moreover, these terms can be amended in
appropriate situations. Customer purchase orders are received for specific quantities with predominantly fixed pricing and delivery requirements. Thus, for the
majority of our contracts, there is no guarantee of any revenue to the Company until a customer submits a purchase order. As a result, the Company generally
considers its arrangement with a customer to be the combination of the master services arrangement and the purchase order. Most of the Company's arrangements
with customers create a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct.

The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if the
Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit
margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract by contract basis.

If an enforceable right to payment for work-in-process does not exist, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer,
which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contract.

For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the
nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company uses a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the
customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of
progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date.

Generally, there are no subjective customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to goods or services provided; if such requirements or
obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.

The Company does not allow for a general right of return. Net sales include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling and out-of-pocket expenses.
The corresponding shipping and handling costs and out-of-pocket expenses are included in cost of sales. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both
imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from net sales.

Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically
recognized as program costs are incurred by utilizing the proportional performance model. The completed performance model is used if certain customer
acceptance criteria exist. Any losses are recognized when anticipated.

_Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying_
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating

33

loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior
earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of
a deferred tax asset.

_Share-Based Compensation: Generally accepted accounting principles require all grants of share-based compensation to employees to be measured at fair value_
and expensed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant. We use the BlackScholes valuation model to value stock options, the Monte Carlo valuation model to value performance stock units with market conditions and the share price on
the date of grant for performance stock units that vest based on other non-market-based performance conditions.

_Inventories:_ Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Valuing inventories at the lower of
cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of
reasons that are beyond the Company’s control. Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory. Any actions taken by the
Company’s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.

_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment_
and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through
estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a
charge against current operations. The impairment analysis is based on management’s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future
performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.

**ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

**Foreign Currency Risk**

Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk. Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner
that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures
associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally
offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges.

Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:

2019 2018

Net Sales 10% 10%

Total Costs 16% 15%

The Company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods
presented above. Based on the Company’s overall currency exposure, as of September 28, 2019, a 10.0% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other
transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

**Interest Rate Risk**

We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The primary objective of our investment
activities is to preserve principal, while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk. To achieve this, we maintain our portfolio of cash
equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities, money market funds and certificates of deposit, and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer.

As of September 28, 2019, our only material interest rate risk is associated with our Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the
Company's option, at a eurocurrency or base rate plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin based on the Company's then-current leverage ratio (as
defined in the Credit Agreement). As of September 28, 2019, the borrowing rate under the Credit Agreement was LIBOR plus 1.10%. The Company is monitoring
developments related to LIBOR; see also Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" for more information. Borrowings under the 2018 NPA are based on a fixed interest rate,
thus mitigating much of our interest rate risk. Based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure, as of September 28, 2019, a 10.0% change in interest rates
would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

To the Shareholders
and Board of Directors
of Plexus Corp.


**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**


**_Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 28, 2019 and September 29,
2018, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 28, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated
financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2019, based on criteria established in
_Internal Control - Integrated Framework_ (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September
28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2019 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the COSO.

_Change in Accounting Principle_

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers
in 2019.

**_Basis for Opinions_**

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

**_Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures

37


-----

Table of Contents

that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**_Critical Audit Matters_**

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

_Arrangements with customers for which revenue is recognized over time_

As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 90% of the Company’s revenue for the year ended September 28, 2019 was
recognized as products were produced or services were rendered over time. Revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which (i) the
Company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a
reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit margin requires judgment
and is assessed on a contract by contract basis. If either of these two conditions are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the
transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.
Management recognizes revenue over time using a cost-based input measurement of progress. Under this method, the extent of progress towards completion is
measured based on the costs incurred to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to arrangements with customers for which revenue is recognized over time is
a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management in (i) determining which arrangements with customers meet the criteria for revenue to
be recognized over time and (ii) estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized for in-progress performance obligations, including estimating a reasonable
profit margin. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate arrangements where revenue is
recognized over time, including the costs incurred to date and estimated reasonable profit margin.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls relating to management’s
determination of which arrangements with customers met the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time and estimating the amount of revenue recognized for
these arrangements. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining which arrangements with customers met the
criteria for revenue to be recognized over time, (ii) testing the accuracy and completeness of costs incurred to date for selected arrangements, (iii) evaluating the
reasonableness of management’s estimate of profit margins, and (iv) testing the appropriateness of the timing and amount of revenue recognized based on the
underlying inputs and estimates for selected arrangements.

_Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting_
principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.

Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30. The Company also uses a "4-4-5" weekly accounting system for the interim periods in
each quarter. Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period. Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align
with the Saturday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 each included 52 weeks.

_Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash: Cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value_
hierarchy described below. Restricted cash represents cash received from customers to settle invoices sold under accounts receivable purchase agreements that is
contractually required to be set aside. The restrictions will lapse when the cash is remitted to the purchaser of the receivables. Restricted cash is also classified as
Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described below.

As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands):

2019 2018

Cash $ 85,688 $ 99,197

Money market funds and other 138,073 198,072

Restricted cash 2,493 417

Total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 226,254 $ 297,686

_Inventories:_ Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Valuing inventories at the lower of
cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of
reasons that are beyond the Company’s control. Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory. Any actions taken by the
Company’s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.

In certain instances, in accordance with contractual terms, the Company receives customer deposits to offset obsolete and excess inventory risks.

_Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated_
useful lives of the respective assets. Estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are generally as follows:

Buildings and improvements 5-39 years

Machinery and equipment 3-7 years

Computer hardware and software 3-10 years

Certain facilities and equipment held under capital leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the term
of the lease and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities. Amortization of assets held under capital leases is included in depreciation expense (see Note 3,
"Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred.

The Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use. This includes costs of the software, consulting
services and compensation costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software.

_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment_
and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through
estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a
charge against current operations. The impairment analysis is based on management’s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections.
Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future
performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.

_Revenue Recognition: ASU 2014-09, Topic 606, which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019, resulted in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a_
significant portion of the Company's revenue, whereby revenue is now recognized over time as products are produced, as opposed to at a point in time based upon
shipping terms. Since adopting the standard, revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not
create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for
performance completed to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. If either of the two
conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which
typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.

The Company recognizes revenue when a contract exists and when, or as, it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a
customer. Contracts are accounted for when they have approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are
identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a
distinct good or service to the customer.

The Company generally enters into a master services arrangement that establishes the framework under which business will be conducted. These arrangements
represent the master terms and conditions of the Company's services that apply to individual orders, but they do not commit the customer to work with, or to
continue to work with, the Company nor do they obligate the customer to any specific volume or pricing of purchases. Moreover, these terms can be amended in
appropriate situations. Customer purchase orders are received for specific quantities with predominantly fixed pricing and delivery requirements. Thus, for the
majority of our contracts, there is no guarantee of any revenue to the Company until a customer submits a purchase order. As a result, the Company generally
considers its arrangement with a customer to be the combination of the master services arrangement and the purchase order. Most of the Company's arrangements
with customers create a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct.

The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if the
Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit
margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract by contract basis.

If an enforceable right to payment for work-in-process does not exist, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer,
which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contract.

For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the
nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company uses a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the
customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of
progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date.

Generally, there are no subjective customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to goods or services provided; if such requirements or
obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.

The Company does not allow for a general right of return. Net sales include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling and out-of-pocket expenses.
The corresponding shipping and handling costs and out-of-pocket expenses are included

in cost of sales. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are
collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from net sales.

Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically
recognized as program costs are incurred by utilizing the proportional performance model. The completed performance model is used if certain customer
acceptance criteria exist. Any losses are recognized when anticipated. Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than 5.0% of

consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.

_Income Taxes: Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement_
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In
determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback
and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.

_Foreign Currency Translation & Transactions: The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional_
currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date and net sales, expenses and cash flows at the
average exchange rates during the respective periods. Adjustments resulting from translation of the financial statements are recorded as a component of
"Accumulated other comprehensive loss." Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the
entity involved and remeasurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are included in the Consolidated Statements
of Comprehensive Income as a component of "Miscellaneous, net." Exchange gains on foreign currency transactions were $0.5 million, $1.2 million and $2.3
million for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts include the amount of gain recognized in income during each fiscal year due to forward
currency exchange contracts entered into to hedge recognized assets or liabilities ("non-designated hedges") the Company entered into during each respective year.
Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further details on derivatives.

_Derivatives: All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheets at fair value. The Company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and_
interest rate swaps. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a non-designated hedge or a hedge of a forecasted
transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a "cash flow" hedge). The Company does not enter
into derivatives for speculative purposes. Changes in the fair value of non-designated derivatives are recorded in earnings as are the gains or losses related to the
hedged asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss"
within shareholders' equity, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. Certain forward currency exchange contracts are treated as cash flow hedges
and, therefore, $1.1 million, $(3.9) million and $2.4 million was recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

See Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further information.

_Grants from Government Authorities: Grants from governments are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant funds will be_
received and the Company will comply with all attached conditions to the grant. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are recorded as an
offset to the carrying value of the related assets at the time of capitalization. Government grants relating to other costs incurred are recognized as an offset to those
related costs, for which the grants are intended to compensate for, at the time they are recognized.

_Earnings Per Share: The computation of basic earnings per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net_
income. The computation of diluted earnings per common share reflects additional dilution from share-based awards, excluding any with an antidilutive effect. See
Note 7, "Earnings Per Share," for further information.

_Share-based Compensation: The Company measures all grants of share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, at fair value_
and expenses them in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant. See Note 9,
"Benefit Plans," for further information.

_Comprehensive Income (Loss): The Company follows the established standards for reporting comprehensive income (loss), which is defined as the changes in_
equity of an enterprise except those resulting from shareholder transactions.

Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of the following as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 (in thousands):

2019 2018

Foreign currency translation adjustments $ (17,395) $ (10,540)

Cumulative change in fair value of derivative instruments (389) (1,439)

Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (17,784) $ (11,979)

Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further explanation regarding the change in fair value of derivative instruments that is recorded to
"Accumulated other comprehensive loss."

_Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the_
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

_Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The Company holds financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable,_
certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements, accounts payable, debt, derivatives, and capital lease obligations. The carrying values of cash
and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable as reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value.
Derivatives and certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements are recorded at fair value. Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable
value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances. Anticipated losses are based on management’s analysis of historical losses and changes
in customers’ credit status. The fair value of the Company’s debt was $252.3 million and $151.9 million as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018,
respectively. The carrying value of the Company's debt was $245.0 million and $150.0 million as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.
The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, longterm debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below. The fair values of the Company’s derivatives
are disclosed in Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements." The fair values of the deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements are
discussed in Note 9, "Benefit Plans."

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value
must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The input levels are:

Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.

_Business and Credit Concentrations: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents,_
trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties. In accordance with the Company’s investment policy, the Company’s
cash, cash equivalents and derivative instruments were placed with recognized financial institutions. The Company’s investment policy limits the amount of credit
exposure in any one issue and the maturity date of the investment securities that typically comprise investment grade short-term debt instruments. Concentrations
of credit risk in accounts receivable resulting from sales to major customers are discussed in Note 11, "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major
Customers". The Company, at times, requires cash deposits for services performed. The Company also closely monitors extensions of credit.

_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:_

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued ASU 2016-16 related to the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of
assets other than inventory. The new standard eliminates the exception for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory and requires an entity to
recognize the income tax consequences when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted this guidance under the modified retrospective approach during the first
quarter of fiscal

**Plexus Corp.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

2019. The Company recognized no net impact to its fiscal 2019 opening Retained Earnings balance upon adoption and does not anticipate any material impact to
the Company's future Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments, which clarifies how entities should classify
certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The new standard addresses certain issues where diversity in practice was identified. It also
amends existing guidance, which is principles based and often requires judgment to determine the appropriate classification of cash flows as operating, investing or
financing activities and clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of
cash flows. The Company adopted this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with no material impact to the Company's Statements of Cash Flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize revenue relating to contracts with customers that depicts the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services
("Topic 606"). Topic 606 also requires disclosures enabling users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and
cash flows arising from contracts with customers and was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.

On September 30, 2018, the Company adopted and applied Topic 606 to all contracts using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Upon adoption, the
Company recognized an increase to its fiscal 2019 beginning Retained Earnings balance of $7.8 million. The comparative information has not been restated and
continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. Refer to Note 15, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," for further
information.

_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted:_

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets but record expenses on their income
statements in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct
financing leases. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The standard must be adopted using a modified
retrospective approach. The Company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and intends to elect the package of practical expedients offered,
which allows entities to not reassess: (i) whether any contracts prior to the adoption date are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) whether capitalized
initial direct costs continue to meet the definition of initial direct costs under the new guidance. For all new and modified leases after adoption, management
elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all of the Company’s leases that qualify, in addition to the practical expedient to not separate lease and
nonlease components. Upon adoption of this new guidance, the Company expects to recognize $35 million to $55 million of right-of-use assets and corresponding
lease liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company also expects to reclassify amounts currently held on the balance sheet to right-of-use assets and
lease liabilities upon adoption due to existing arrangements subject to the new standard. In addition, the Company expects to recognize a decrease to fiscal 2020
beginning Retained Earnings of $0 - $5 million as a result of two existing build-to-suit arrangements for the facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico that were reassessed
to be finance leases under the new standard. The Company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit
losses and required consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This guidance is effective for the
Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the impact of the
adoption of the new standard on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 related to the accounting for hedging activities. The pronouncement expands and refines hedge accounting, aligns
the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to
ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2020. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the
impact of the new standard on future periods will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions.

The Company believes that no other recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, or apply to its
operations.

Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of current portion $ 187,278 $ 183,085

On June 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “2018 NPA”) pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of $150.0 million in principal

amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $100.0 million in principal amount of 4.05% Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and $50.0 million in

principal amount of 4.22% Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the “2018 Notes”), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes
customary operational and financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios
such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a makewhole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. At September 28, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2018
NPA.

In connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, on June 15, 2018, the Company repaid, on maturity $175.0 million in principal amount of its

previous 5.20% Senior Notes.

On May 15, 2019, the Company refinanced its then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Prior Credit Facility") by entering into a new 5-year

senior unsecured revolving credit facility (collectively with the Prior Credit Facility, referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum
commitment from $300.0 million to $350.0 million and extended the maturity from July 5, 2021 to May 15, 2024. The maximum commitment under the Credit
Facility may be further increased to $600.0 million, generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions.
During fiscal 2019, the highest daily borrowing was $250.0 million; the average daily borrowings were $140.7 million. The Company borrowed $1,084.5 million
and repaid $989.5 million of revolving borrowings under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2019. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants

relating to the Credit Agreement, which are generally consistent with those in the 2018 NPA discussed above. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee
on the daily unused revolver credit commitment based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 0.125% as of September 28, 2019.

Total $ 44,492

The Company's weighted average interest rate on capital lease obligations was 4.82% and 4.87% as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.

The "Thereafter" line of the scheduled maturities of capital lease obligations table above includes an $8.8 million non-cash financing obligation related to a failed

sale-leaseback of a building shell in Guadalajara, Mexico that was capitalized in fiscal 2014. This obligation will be increased by interest expense and land rent
expense, and reduced by contractual payments during the 20-year lease term. The lease contains a 10-year base lease agreement with two 5-year renewal options.

As of September 29, 2018, the balance of the related financing obligation totaled $8.6 million. At the end of the 20-year lease term, the net book value of the assets
will approximate the balance of the financing obligation. If the Company does not exercise both renewal options or exercises the first but not the second, it would
record a loss related to the disposal of the underlying assets in operating results of $4.1 million in fiscal 2024 or $0.8 million in fiscal 2029.

Construction on a second manufacturing facility in Guadalajara, Mexico began in fiscal 2018, resulting in an additional $11.6 million of non-cash financing

obligations that were capitalized as of September 28, 2019. As of September 29, 2018, the balance of the related financing obligation totaled $7.2 million. This
obligation will be increased as construction costs are incurred and also by interest expense and land rent expense, and reduced by contractual payments during the
25-year lease term. The lease contains a 15-year base lease agreement with two 5-year renewal options. The obligation is included in the "Thereafter" line of the

scheduled maturities of capital lease obligations table above, as well as in long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of current portion, on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2019.

The future minimum payments under the remainder of the leases for the two facilities in Guadalajara, which are leased under 10-year and 15-year base lease

agreements, as well as the two 5-year renewal options for each lease are as follows (in thousands):

**5.  Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements**

All derivatives are recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. The Company uses derivatives to manage the
variability of foreign currency obligations. The Company has cash flow hedges related to forecasted foreign currency obligations, in addition to non-designated
hedges to manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into
derivatives for speculative purposes.

The Company designates some foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency expenses. Changes in the fair value of the
derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets until
earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows. In the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $0.6 million of unrealized losses, net of tax,
related to cash flow

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

hedges will be reclassified from other comprehensive (loss) income into earnings. Changes in the fair value of the non-designated derivatives related to recognized
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are recorded in "Miscellaneous, net" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts for its operations in Malaysia and Mexico on a rolling basis. The Company had cash flow hedges
outstanding with a notional value of $80.0 million as of September 28, 2019, and a notional value of $74.0 million as of September 29, 2018. These forward
currency contracts fix the exchange rates for the settlement of future foreign currency obligations that have yet to be realized. The total fair value of the forward
currency exchange contracts was a $0.6 million liability as of September 28, 2019, and a $1.7 million liability as of September 29, 2018.

The Company had additional forward currency exchange contracts outstanding as of September 28, 2019, with a notional value of $34.4 million; there were $28.6

million such contracts outstanding as of September 29, 2018. The Company did not designate these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net
settlement amount (fair value) related to these contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either a current or long-term asset or liability, depending
on the term, and as an element of "Miscellaneous, net." The total fair value of these derivatives was a $0.9 million asset as of September 28, 2019, and a $0.1
million liability as of September 29, 2018.

The following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rates reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017:

2019 2018 2017

Federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 24.5 % 35.0 %

Increase (decrease) resulting from:

Foreign tax rate differences (21.0) (30.2) (39.9)

Withholding tax on dividends (5.4) 23.7 —

Permanent differences (1.3) 0.8 3.0

Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation (1.3) (2.7) (2.0)

Global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") 11.7 — —

Deemed repatriation tax 5.6 92.2 —

Non-deductible compensation 1.5 0.2 0.2

Valuation allowances 1.5 (30.6) 12.2

Rate changes — 9.0 —

Other, net 1.5 1.0 (0.5)

Effective income tax rate 13.8 % 87.9 % 8.0 %

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 primarily due to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax

Reform”) that was recorded in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, the Company reasserted that certain historical undistributed earnings of two foreign subsidiaries
will be permanently reinvested which provided a $10.5 million benefit to the effective tax rate. The impact of the changes in the Company's assertion has been
included in "Withholding tax on dividends" in the effective income tax reconciliation above. The reduction to the effective tax rate compared to fiscal 2018 was
offset by an increase due to the GILTI provisions of Tax Reform in fiscal 2019. The GILTI impact in the table above includes the deduction allowed by the
regulations as well as the foreign tax credits attributed to GILTI. The Company has elected to treat the income tax effects of GILTI as a period cost. The effective
tax rate for fiscal 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 primarily due to expenses related to Tax Reform.

During fiscal 2019, the Company recorded a $1.9 million increase to its valuation allowance due to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER and
EMEA segments, partially offset by an expiration of net operating losses that had a valuation allowance recorded.

During fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a $32.9 million reduction to its valuation allowance which includes $9.7 million related to the U.S. federal tax rate

change as part of Tax Reform from 35% to 21%, $21.0 million of carryforward credits and net operating losses utilized against the deemed repatriation of
undistributed foreign earnings and $3.6 million for the release of the U.S. valuation allowance due to the expected future U.S. taxable income related to the GILTI
provisions of Tax Reform. These benefits were partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in foreign valuation allowances in the EMEA segment.

During fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a $14.9 million addition to its valuation allowance relating to continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the
AMER and EMEA segments.

Deferred income tax liabilities 26,868 27,465

Net deferred income tax assets/(liabilities) $ 8,349 $ (3,551)

During fiscal 2019, the Company’s valuation allowance increased by $0.8 million. This increase is the result of increases to the valuation allowances against the
net deferred tax assets in the AMER region of $1.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax assets in the EMEA region of $0.9 million.

As of September 28, 2019, the Company had approximately $189.2 million of pre-tax state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between fiscal 2020 and
2040. Certain state net operating losses have a full valuation allowance against them. The Company also had approximately $79.6 million of pre-tax foreign net
operating loss carryforwards that expire between fiscal 2019 and 2025 or are indefinitely carried forward. These foreign net operating losses have a full valuation
allowance against them.

During fiscal 2019, proposed and final regulations were issued and tax legislation was adopted in various jurisdictions. The impacts of these regulations and
legislation on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are included above.

The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary in the APAC segment. This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2024, and is subject to

certain conditions with which the Company expects to continue to comply. During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, the tax holiday resulted in tax reductions of
approximately $23.9 million net of the impact of the GILTI provisions of Tax Reform ($0.79 per basic share, $0.77 per diluted share), $39.1 million ($1.19 per

basic share, $1.15 per diluted share) and $37.5 million ($1.11 per basic share, $1.08 per diluted share), respectively.

The Company does not provide for taxes that would be payable if certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted because the Company
considers these earnings to be permanently reinvested. The deferred tax liability that has not been recorded for these earnings was approximately $10.5 million as
of September 28, 2019.

The Company has approximately $2.3 million of uncertain tax benefits as of September 28, 2019. The Company has classified these amounts in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as "Other liabilities" (noncurrent) in the amount of $1.5 million and an offset to "Deferred income taxes" (noncurrent asset) in the amount of $0.8

million. The Company has classified these amounts as "Other liabilities" (noncurrent) and "Deferred income taxes" (noncurrent asset) to the extent that payment is
not anticipated within one year.

September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The total accrued penalties and net accrued
interest with respect to income taxes was approximately $0.2 million for each of the fiscal years ended September 28, 2019, September 29, 2018 and September 30,

2017. The Company recognized less than $0.1 million of expense for accrued penalties and net accrued interest in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive

Income for each of the fiscal years ended September 28, 2019, September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017.

It is possible that a number of uncertain tax positions may be settled within the next 12 months. Settlement of these matters is not expected to have a material
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

The Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal, state, local and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The following tax years

**9.  Benefit Plans**

_Share-based Compensation Plans: The Plexus Corp. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"), which was approved by shareholders, is a stock and cash-_
based incentive plan, and includes provisions by which the Company may grant executive officers, employees and directors stock options, stock appreciation
rights ("SARs"), restricted stock (including restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance stock awards (including performance stock units ("PSUs"), other stock
awards and cash incentive awards. Similar awards were offered under its predecessor, the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan"), which is no longer
being used for grants; however, outstanding awards granted under the 2008 Plan and its predecessors continue in accordance with their terms.

The maximum number of shares of Plexus common stock that may be issued pursuant to the 2016 Plan is 3.2 million shares; in addition, cash incentive awards of

up to $4.0 million per employee may be granted annually. The exercise price of each stock option and SAR granted must not be less than the fair market value on
the date of grant. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors may establish a term and vesting period
for awards under the 2016 Plan as well as accelerate the vesting of such awards. Generally, stock options vest in two annual installments and have a term of ten
years. SARs vest in two annual installments and have a term of seven years. RSUs granted to executive officers, other officers and key employees generally vest on
the third anniversary of the grant date (assuming continued employment), which is also the date as of which the underlying shares will be issued. Beginning for
fiscal 2017 grants, 50% of PSUs vest based on the relative total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company's common stock as compared to the companies in the
Russell 3000 Index, a market condition, and the remaining 50% vest based upon a three-point annual average of the Company's absolute economic return, a
performance condition, each during a performance period of three years performance period. The PSUs granted in fiscal 2016 and prior years vested based solely
on the relative TSR of the Company's common stock as compared to companies in the Russell 3000 Index during a performance period of three years. The
Committee also grants RSUs to non-employee directors, which generally fully vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, which is also the date the underlying
shares are issued (unless further deferred).

The Company recognized $21.3 million, $18.0 million and $17.4 million of compensation expense associated with share-based awards in fiscal 2019, 2018 and

2017, respectively. Deferred tax benefits related to equity awards of $9.2 million and $8.2 million were recognized in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. No

deferred tax benefits related to equity awards were recognized in fiscal 2017.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to value options and SARs. The Company used its historical stock prices as the basis for its volatility
assumptions. The assumed risk-free rates were based on U.S. Treasury rates in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the expected option and SAR
lives. The expected options and SARs lives represent the period of time that the options and SARs granted are expected to be outstanding and were based on
historical experience.

There were no options or SARs granted for fiscal 2019 or 2018. The weighted average fair value per share of options and SARs granted for fiscal 2017 was $15.66.

The fair value of each option and SAR grant was estimated at the date of grant in fiscal 2017 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the
assumption ranges below:

The fair value of options and SARs vested for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $0.3 million, $1.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively.

For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, the total intrinsic value of options and SARs exercised was $2.4 million, $10.9 million and $10.2 million, respectively.

As of September 28, 2019, all previously granted options and SARS have vested.

The Company uses the fair value at the date of grant to value RSUs. As of September 28, 2019, there was $15.4 million of unrecognized compensation expense

related to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.

The Company uses the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the fair value of PSUs at the date of grant for PSUs that vest based on relative TSR performance.
The Company uses the stock price on the date of grant for PSUs that vest based on economic return. Vesting of all PSUs granted in fiscal 2016 and prior years is
based on the relative TSR of Plexus stock as compared to the TSR of companies in the Russell 3000 Index during a performance period of three years. Beginning in
fiscal 2017, 50% of the PSUs vest based on relative TSR performance, with the other 50% vesting based on a three-point annual average of the Company's
absolute economic return, each during a performance period of three years. The vesting and payout of awards will range between 0% and 200% of the shares

granted based upon performance on the metrics during a performance period. Payout at target, 100% of the shares granted, will occur if the TSR of Plexus stock is
at the 50th percentile of companies in the Russell 3000 Index during the performance period and if a 2.5% average economic return is achieved over the

performance period of three years. The number of shares that may be issued pursuant to PSUs ranges from zero to 0.5 million.

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense over the vesting period of PSUs. During the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, the 0.1 million

PSUs granted in fiscal 2016 vested at a 173.2% payout based upon the TSR performance achieved during the performance period. There were 0.1 million PSUs

granted during each of fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017.

**Plexus Corp.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

As of September 28, 2019, at the target achievement level, there was $7.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to PSUs that is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years.

_401(k) Savings Plan: The Company’s 401(k) Retirement Plan covers all eligible U.S. employees. The Company matches employee contributions up to 4.0% of_

eligible earnings. The Company’s contributions for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled $9.3 million, $8.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively.

_Deferred Compensation Arrangements: The Company has agreements with certain former executive officers to provide nonqualified deferred compensation._
Under these agreements, the Company agrees to pay these former executives, or their designated beneficiaries upon such executives’ deaths, certain amounts
annually for the first 15 years subsequent to their retirement. As of both September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the related deferred compensation liability
associated with these arrangements totaled $0.2 million.

The Company maintains investments in a trust account to fund required payments under these deferred compensation arrangements. As of September 28, 2019 and

September 29, 2018, the total value of the assets held by the trust totaled $10.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and was recorded at fair value on a

recurring basis. These assets were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting
Policies." During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company made payments to the participants in the amount of $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.4 million,

respectively.

_Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Company also maintains a supplemental executive retirement plan (the "SERP") as an additional deferred_
compensation plan for executive officers. Under the SERP, a covered executive may elect to defer some or all of the participant’s compensation into the plan, and
the Company may credit the participant’s account with a discretionary employer contribution. Participants are entitled to payment of deferred amounts and any
related earnings upon termination or retirement from Plexus.

The SERP allows investment of deferred compensation into individual accounts and, within these accounts, into one or more designated investments. Investment
choices do not include Plexus stock. During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company made contributions to the participants’ SERP accounts in the amount of $0.6

million, $1.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively.

As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the SERP assets held in the trust totaled $12.1 million and $11.7 million, respectively, and the related liability

to the participants totaled approximately $12.1 million and $11.7 million, respectively. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, the SERP assets held in
the trust were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 1, "Description of Business and
Significant Accounting Policies."

The trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. The deferred compensation and trust assets and the related liabilities to the participants are
included in non-current "Other assets" and non-current "Other liabilities," respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**10.  Litigation**

The Company is party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will
have a material positive or adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

**11.  Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers**

Reportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or group, in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company uses an internal management reporting system, which
provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the Company’s resources on a regional basis. Net sales for the segments are attributed to the
region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed. The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and
order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments. A segment’s performance is evaluated based upon its operating
income (loss). A segment’s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and
other expenses. Corporate and other expenses

primarily represent corporate selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring costs and other charges, if any, such as the $1.7 million of restructuring costs in

fiscal 2019 and the $13.5 million one-time employee bonus paid to full-time, non-executive employees during fiscal 2018 due to the Company's ability to access
overseas cash as a result of Tax Reform (the "one-time employee bonus"). These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when
assessing the performance of the segments. Inter-segment transactions are generally recorded at amounts that approximate arm’s length transactions. The
accounting policies for the segments are the same as for the Company taken as a whole.

As the Company operates flexible manufacturing facilities and processes designed to accommodate customers with multiple product lines and configurations, it is
impracticable to report net sales for individual products or services or groups of similar products and services.

Long-lived assets as of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 exclude other long-term assets, deferred income tax assets and intangible assets, which
totaled $78.4 million and $74.2 million, respectively.

As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10.0% or more of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017

were as follows:

2019 2018 2017

General Electric Company ("GE") 12.4% 12.3% 12.2%

During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, net sales attributable to GE were reported in all three reportable segments.

As of September 28, 2019, GE represented 10.1% of total accounts receivable. As of September 29, 2018, GE represented 10.9% of total accounts receivable.

**12.  Guarantees**

The Company offers certain indemnifications under its customer manufacturing agreements. In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to
time be obligated to indemnify its customers or its customers’ customers against damages or liabilities arising out of the Company’s negligence, misconduct,
breach of contract, or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Certain agreements have extended broader indemnification, and while most
agreements have contractual limits, some do not. However, the Company generally does not provide for such indemnities and seeks indemnification from its
customers for damages or liabilities arising out of the Company’s adherence to customers’ specifications or designs or use of materials furnished, or directed to be
used, by its customers. The Company does not believe its obligations under such indemnities are material.

In the normal course of business, the Company also provides its customers a limited warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products
manufactured by the Company. Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company’s workmanship and meet mutually
agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 12 months to 24 months. The Company’s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its
expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product. The Company’s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied
components, design defects or damage caused by any party or cause other than the Company.

The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional
reserves for specifically identified product issues. These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement and are
included in the Company's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in "other current accrued liabilities." The primary factors that affect the Company’s
warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims. As these factors are impacted by actual
experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

**13.  Shareholders' Equity**

On August 20, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase plan under which the Company is authorized to repurchase $50.0 million of its

common stock (the "2019 Program"). The 2019 Program commenced upon completion of the 2018 Program, as defined below. During fiscal 2019, the Company
repurchased 54,965 shares under this program for $3.3 million at an average price of $59.66 per share. As of September 28, 2019, $46.7 million of authority

remained under the 2019 Program.

On February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan under which the Company was authorized to repurchase $200.0 million of its

common stock (the "2018 Program"). The 2018 Program commenced upon completion of the 2016 Program, as defined below. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, the
Company completed the 2018 Program by repurchasing 3,129,059 and 343,642 shares under this program for $178.8 million and $21.2 million, at an average price
of $57.15 and $61.61 per share, respectively.

On June 6, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a multi-year stock repurchase program under which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to $150.0

million of its common stock beginning in fiscal 2017 (the "2016 Program"). During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the Company completed the 2016 Program by
repurchasing 1,914,596 and 655,470 shares for $115.9 million and $34.1 million, at an average price of $60.52 and $52.08 per share, respectively.

All shares repurchased under the aforementioned programs were recorded as treasury stock.

**14.  Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs**

The Company has Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements with MUFG Bank, New York Branch (formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ, Ltd.) (the "MUFG RPA"), and HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA"), under which the Company may elect to sell
receivables; at a discount. These facilities are uncommitted facilities. The MUFG RPA was amended in fiscal 2019 to increase the maximum facility amount from
$260.0 million to $280.0 million. The maximum facility amount under the HSBC RPA as of September 28, 2019 is $60.0 million. The MUFG RPA is subject to

expiration on December 13, 2019, but will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should
not be extended. The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA discussed above.

The Company sold receivables under a former trade accounts receivable sale program that expired during the first fiscal quarter of 2017.

Transfers of receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts
receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Proceeds
from the transfer reflect the face value of the receivables less a discount. The sale discount is recorded within "Miscellaneous, net" in the Consolidated Statements
of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale.

The Company sold $919.3 million, $712.9 million and $418.0 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs, or their predecessors, during fiscal
years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of $913.6 million, $708.6 million and $415.8 million, respectively.

**15.  Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

_Impact of Adopting Topic 606_

The Company adopted Topic 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method. The new standard resulted in a change to the timing of
revenue recognition for a significant portion of the Company's revenue, whereby revenue is recognized over time, as products are produced, as opposed to at a
point in time based upon shipping terms. As a result of the adoption of Topic 606, the following adjustments were made to the opening balances of the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

Impacts due to adoption of Topic

Balance at September 29, 2018 606 Balance at September 30, 2018

**ASSETS**

Contract assets $ — $ 76,417 $ 76,417

Inventories 794,346 (68,959) 725,387

**LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**
Other accrued liabilities $ 68,163 $ (357) $ 67,806

Retained earnings 1,062,246 7,815 1,070,061

The cumulative effect of applying the new guidance in Topic 606 resulted in the Company increasing its fiscal 2019 opening Retained earnings balance by $7.8

million due to certain customer contracts requiring revenue recognition over time. Contract assets in the amount of $76.4 million were recognized due to the

recognition of revenue on an over time basis for some customers rather than at a specific point in time. Inventory declined $69.0 million primarily due to earlier
recognition of costs related to the contracts for which revenue was recognized on an over time basis. The decline in other accrued liabilities is primarily due to the
reclassification of deferred revenue to contract assets for prepayments associated with revenue recognized over time, partially offset by an increase in taxes
payable associated with the increase in revenue recognized over time.

The effects of the adoption on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 was as follows (in thousands):

_Significant Judgments_

Topic 606 resulted in a change to the timing of revenue recognition for a significant portion of the Company's revenue, whereby revenue is now recognized over
time as products are produced, as opposed to at a point in time based upon shipping terms. Since adopting the standard, revenue is recognized over time for
arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has
an enforceable right to payment, including reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs
incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. If either of the two conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized
following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying
arrangement.

The Company recognizes revenue when a contract exists and when, or as, it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a
customer. Contracts are accounted for when they have approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are
identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a
distinct good or service to the customer.

The Company generally enters into a master services arrangement that establishes the framework under which business will be conducted. These arrangements
represent the master terms and conditions of the Company's services that apply to individual orders, but they do not commit the customer to work with, or to
continue to work with, the Company nor do they obligate the customer to any specific volume or pricing of purchases. Moreover, these terms can be amended in
appropriate situations. Customer purchase orders are received for specific quantities with predominantly fixed pricing and delivery requirements. Thus, for the
majority of our contracts, there is no guarantee of any revenue to the Company until a customer submits a purchase order. As a result, the Company generally
considers its arrangement with a customer to be the combination of the master services arrangement and the purchase order. Most of the Company's arrangements
with customers create a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct.

The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if the
Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit
margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract by contract basis.

Generally, there are no subjective customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to goods or services provided; if such requirements or
obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.

The Company does not allow for a general right of return. Net sales include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling and out-of-pocket expenses.
The corresponding shipping and handling costs and out-of-pocket expenses are included in cost of sales. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both
imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from net sales.

_Practical Expedients_

The Company applied the following practical expedients during the adoption of Topic 606:

-  The Company elected not to disclose information about remaining performance obligations as its performance obligations generally have expected
durations of one year or less.

-  The Company will account for certain shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the good, instead of a promised service to its
customer.

65


-----

Table of Contents
**Plexus Corp.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

-  The Company elected not to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the Company expects, at
contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good
or service will generally be one year or less.

_Contract Costs_

For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the
nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company uses a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the
customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of
progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date.

There were no other costs to obtain or fulfill customer contracts.

Segment revenue $ 1,429,308 $ 1,557,205 $ 309,933 $ 3,296,446

For the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, approximately 90% of the Company's revenue was recognized as products and services were transferred over time,
respectively.

_Contract Balances_

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, contract assets, and deferred revenue on the Company’s
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contract Assets: For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, at which point the customer has been
billed and the resulting asset is recorded within accounts receivable. For performance obligations satisfied over time as work progresses, the Company has an
unconditional right to payment, which results in the recognition of contract assets. The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's contract assets
during the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019 (in thousands):

Contract Assets

Beginning balance, September 29, 2018 $ —

Cumulative effect adjustment at September 29, 2018 76,417

Ending balance, September 28, 2019 $ 90,841

Table of Contents
**Plexus Corp.**
**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

Deferred Revenue: Deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the
terms of the contract, which is included in other accrued liabilities. As of September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 the balance of prepayments from customers
that remained in other accrued liabilities was $67.9 million and $35.9 million, respectively. The advance payment is not considered a significant financing
component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract, offset obsolete and excess inventory risks and to
protect the company from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. Deferred revenue is recognized into
revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met. For performance obligations satisfied over time, recognition will occur as work progresses; otherwise
deferred revenue will be recognized based upon shipping terms.

**16.  Acquisition**

On July 27, 2018, the Company purchased the assets of one of the business lines of Cascade Controls, Inc. ("Cascade"), a new product introduction company in
Portland, Oregon, for $12.4 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. In the three months ended December 29, 2018, the Company
received a $1.2 million purchase price adjustment as a result of a post-closing adjustment. Plexus acquired substantially all of the inventory, equipment and other
assets of the business line, hired a majority of its employees and sub-leased one of Cascade's facilities. This transaction has been accounted for as a business
combination.

The acquisition resulted in a $12.4 million cash outflow in fiscal 2018 and a $1.2 million cash inflow in fiscal 2019 included in "Business acquisition" in the

accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, $8.2 million and $6.9 million of intangible assets related to customer relationships is
included in non-current "Other" assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet for fiscal 2018 and 2019, respectively. The intangible assets are amortized
on a straight-line basis and result in amortization expense for fiscal 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 of approximately $1.2 million per year. There were no other
material impacts to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of the acquisition.

**DISCLOSURE**

None.

**ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**

**Disclosure Controls and Procedures**

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief
Financial Officer ("CFO") have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by
this report. Based on such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 28, 2019, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective, at the reasonable assurance level, (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

**Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Management of the Company, including its CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting as of September 28, 2019, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") (2013). Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has reached the conclusion that the
Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
September 28, 2019, as stated in its report included herein.

**Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

**Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls**

Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent
limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the
effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting are effective.

**Exhibit 4.3**

**DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK**

The following summary highlights selected information about the common stock of Plexus Corp. (“Plexus,” the “Company,”

“we,” “us,” or “our”). This summary does not purport to be exhaustive and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable
Wisconsin law, as well as to our Articles and our Amended and Restated Bylaws.

The Plexus Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the “Articles”), authorize Plexus to issue 200,000,000 shares of

common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value. The preferred stock may be issued in such series, and with
such designations, as the Board of Directors may specify at the time of issuance. The Articles currently designate 2,000,000 of the
preferred shares as Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock. However, there are not any shares of Series B Junior Participating
Preferred Stock outstanding, nor are any rights to acquire such shares outstanding; all prior powers, preferences, special rights, terms
of and rights to acquire such shares have expired.

The holders of Plexus common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on each matter submitted to a vote

of shareholders. Shareholders have no cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of shares entitled to exercise more
than 50% of the voting rights are able to elect all of the directors. The Articles do not provide for classification of the Board of
Directors.

Subject to any prior rights of holders of preferred stock, dividends may be paid to holders of common stock when, as and if

declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, subject to any contractual restrictions on the payment of
dividends. If Plexus is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the holders of common stock will be entitled to receive their pro rata share
of the assets of Plexus remaining after payment or provision for payment of its debts and other liabilities and the amount of any
preferred stock liquidation preference.

All of our issued and outstanding shares are fully paid and nonassessable.

The holders of common stock are not entitled to any preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights.

The transfer agent and registrar of the Company’s common stock is AST Financial.

The Company’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the Nasdaq Global Select Market tier (symbol: PLXS).

**Certain Statutory Provisions**

The Wisconsin Business Corporation Law (the “WBCL”), under which Plexus is incorporated, contains certain provisions

that may be important when considering the rights of


-----

holders of our capital stock. The description set forth below is a summary only. For complete information, we encourage you to
review the applicable provisions of the WBCL.

_Business Combination Statute. Sections 180.1140 to 180.1144 of the WBCL regulate a broad range of business combinations_

between a "resident domestic corporation" and an "interested shareholder." A business combination is defined to include any of the
following transactions:

- a merger or share exchange;

- a sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of assets equal to 5% or more of the aggregate

market value of the stock or consolidated assets of the resident domestic corporation or 10% of its
consolidated earning power or income;

- the issuance or transfer of stock or rights to purchase stock with a market value equal to 5% or more of the

outstanding stock of the resident domestic corporation;

- the adoption of a plan of liquidation or dissolution; and

- certain other transactions involving an interested shareholder.

A "resident domestic corporation" is defined to mean a Wisconsin corporation that has a class of voting stock that is

registered or traded on a national securities exchange or that is registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and that, as of the relevant date, satisfies any of the following:

- its principal offices are located in Wisconsin;

- it has significant business operations located in Wisconsin;

- more than 10% of the holders of record of its shares are residents of Wisconsin; or

- more than 10% of its shares are held of record by residents of Wisconsin.

Plexus is a resident domestic corporation for purposes of these statutory provisions.

An interested shareholder is defined to mean a person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% of the voting power

of the outstanding voting stock of a resident domestic corporation or who is an affiliate or associate of the resident domestic
corporation and beneficially owned 10% of the voting power of its then outstanding voting stock within the last three years.

Under this law, we cannot engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years

following the date such person becomes an interested shareholder, unless the board of directors approved the business combination
or the acquisition of the stock that resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder before such acquisition. We may
engage in a


-----

business combination with an interested shareholder after the expiration of the three-year period with respect to that shareholder
only if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied:

- the board of directors approved the acquisition of the stock prior to such shareholder's acquisition date;

- the business combination is approved by a majority of the outstanding voting stock not beneficially owned by the

interested shareholder; or

- the consideration to be received by shareholders meets certain fair price requirements of the statute with respect to

form and amount.

_Fair Price Statute. The WBCL also provides, in Sections 180.1130 to 180.1133, that certain mergers, share exchanges or_

sales, leases, exchanges or other dispositions of assets in a transaction involving a "significant shareholder" and a resident domestic
corporation, such as Plexus, require a supermajority vote of shareholders in addition to any approval otherwise required, unless
shareholders receive a fair price for their shares that satisfies a statutory formula. A "significant shareholder" for this purpose is
defined as a person or group who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of the resident domestic
corporation, or is an affiliate of the resident domestic corporation and beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the
voting stock of the resident domestic corporation within the last two years. Any business combination to which the statute applies
must be approved by 80% of the voting power of the resident domestic corporation's stock and at least two-thirds of the voting
power of its stock not beneficially owned by the significant shareholder who is party to the relevant transaction or any of its
affiliates or associates, in each case voting together as a single group, unless the following fair price standards have been met:

- the aggregate value of the per share consideration is equal to the highest of:

-  the highest per share price paid for any common shares of the corporation by the significant
shareholder in the transaction in which it became a significant shareholder or within two years before
the date of the business combination;

-  the market value per share of the corporation's shares on the date of commencement of any tender
offer by the significant shareholder, the date on which the person became a significant shareholder or
the date of the first public announcement of the proposed business combination, whichever is highest;
or

-  the highest preferential liquidation or dissolution distribution to which holders of the shares would be
entitled; and

-  either cash, or the form of consideration used by the significant shareholder to acquire the largest number of
shares, is offered.


-----

_Control Share Voting Restrictions . Under Section 180.1150 of the WBCL, unless otherwise provided in the articles of_

incorporation or otherwise specified by the board of directors, the voting power of shares of a resident domestic corporation held by
any person or group of persons acting together in excess of 20% of the voting power in the election of directors is limited (in voting
on any matter) to 10% of the full voting power of those shares. This restriction does not apply to shares acquired directly from the
resident domestic corporation, in certain specified transactions, or in a transaction in which the corporation's shareholders have
approved restoration of the full voting power of the otherwise restricted shares. The Company’s Articles do not provide otherwise.

_Defensive Action Restrictions. Section 180.1134 of the WBCL provides that, in addition to the vote otherwise required by_

law or the articles of incorporation of a resident domestic corporation, the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled
to vote on the proposal is required before the corporation can take certain action while a takeover offer is being made or after a
takeover offer has been publicly announced and before it is concluded. This statute requires shareholder approval for the corporation
to do either of the following:

- acquire more than 5% of its outstanding voting shares at a price above the market price from any individual or

organization that owns more than 3% of the outstanding voting shares and has held such shares for less than
two years, unless a similar offer is made to acquire all voting shares and all securities which may be
converted into voting shares; or

- sell or option assets of the corporation which amount to 10% or more of the market value of the corporation, unless

the corporation has at least three independent directors (directors who are not officers or employees) and a
majority of the independent directors vote not to have this provision apply to the corporation.

We currently have more than three independent directors. The foregoing restrictions may have the effect of deterring a

shareholder from acquiring our shares with the goal of seeking to have us repurchase such shares at a premium over market price.

_Constituency or Stakeholder Provision. Under Section 180.0827 of the WBCL, in discharging his or her duties to Plexus and_

in determining what he or she believes to be in the best interests of Plexus, a director or officer may, in addition to considering the
effects of any action on shareholders, consider the effects of the action on employees, suppliers, customers, the communities in
which we operate and any other factors that the director or officer considers pertinent.

The foregoing provisions of Wisconsin law, our ability to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock

without further shareholder approval (except as may be required by the Nasdaq Global Select Market corporate governance
standards) and the ability of our Board of Directors to fix the designations of classes of preferred stock (including the ability to issue
preferred stock with substantial voting rights) could have the effect, among others, of discouraging take-over proposals for or
impeding a business combination involving Plexus.
